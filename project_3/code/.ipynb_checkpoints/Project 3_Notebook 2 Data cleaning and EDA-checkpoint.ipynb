By categorizing the current content for both games, we will make it easy for our users to navigate and enhance their user experience. The top 5 features will give the marketing team some insight into their sales and marketing strategy.\n",

He was griefing me , not rolling for offlane ETC, i have grudge againist him, put him on my team and i will just also 2nd pic kofflane // insta pick. In fact imagine a horrible pool whre you got 1500 people in europe where all players roughly have an idea of who everyone else is.  It is just so terrible.  You got bad matchmaking, no anonymity causing all sort of problems, Game is hard and going out of comfort zone to learn is impossible, unranked queue time is always minimum 10 minutes, after which i think game dumps conditions rapidly and so on;\n",

      "Eloboration;  Statistically Speaking, you may need to observe someone for 50 games to be 99.9%+ confidert about fact that they are speaking, however with data of person's settings changes, performance data , clicks per min  data and god knows what other easy to process data valve have,  only 15 games may be enough for 95% prediction if someone is cheating or not, Valve as far as i know does not make use of aggresive punishments, We all know why and it is completely a legit concern they have, but through reduction of impact of unstable players on Dota2's enviroment, instead of having 5000 games griefed, we can have only 1500 games griefed, which is a massive difference, valve needs to relook into their punishment system, by the time they react damage is already being done. This banned player just wont be able to play ranked, or perhaps if very dangerous one, have game limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT; When a booster is destroying game with 95% accuarcy, remember guys if he makes it to selling the account, for each game he have ruined, another guy will ruin another game, eliminating them is like double impact.\n",

      "2- Following very short changes to unranked;  Rapid Queue ; Teams are balanced equally based on hidden mmr, no balancing or minor balancing on MMR Gap,,Role queue is added since previous change should greatly increase amount of games meaning you can play with vastly lower mmr players or highest mmr ones as long as teams are approximately equal as side note; It might be good to keep it simple and set mmr gap based on simply if there are new players or not.\n",

      "Why suggest this? 4k, top 15% percentile psychopath ancient 3 GOD will get to enjoy even if he loses game, by performing good and being satistified with how good he is  , atleast feel better than normal and blame non-existant forced 50% over actually going to a smurf account, High mmr guy wont go to his smurf account to play 5 games of lycan because he did not play lycan for 3 years, We wil lhave a proper casual queue , imagine a totally optional casual queue, this is ued in games like world of tanks and escape from tarkov, you are a god in escape from tarkov? yo uare always a god, except you are maybe 5% god or 0.1% god, in dota2 ur an idiot for being 0.01% in ranked roles because 0.005% guy did not like your performance. This will greatly reduce egoistical smurfs longterm, It will surely make unranked worse for some people, But amount of unranked games is incredibly low in dota2, the queue is kinda dead, while i understand this will upset 5% of people it should greatly help to other 95% And also it may not even upset them, i calibrated at 1.8k, before grinding to 8k, i would always prefer to play in an enviroment where there are more skilled players . Imagine being 4k and getting to play a game that has average 2k or average 6k, i think having this casual queue option is actually a very beatiful thing.

      "There is something I haven't told you about John. I'm not sure why have I left it out before. This event was the trigger that forced John to change his attitude and how he looks at the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The events that you are about to read, happened long before John met Yatoro.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a typical day in John's life. The night before when he went to bed, he promised himself that next day he will be productive and that the first the he will do in the morning is to sit down and study for a few hours and clean his room. He promised himself that he won't play Dota the next day. It's no surprise that the first thing he actually did in the morning was a nice game of Dota. The best thing you can do to wake up and kickstart your day is a game of Dota, right? Turns out it wasn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that there was no rolequeue when this happened. John started Dota, clicked the Find Match button and the clock started ticking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before the game started, he knew he was going to play Sven. He was in the mood for Sven. He wanted to AFK farm and oneshot people with a crit. His life was dominating him. So he wanted to dominate others. He didn't care about a good team composition or natural pick orders with supports picking first. He wanted to pick carry and play Sven. There is forced 50% winrate anyway, he thought. So why not?\n",
      "\n",
      "While the system was searching for a game, he was scrolling trough Facebook and Instagram, looking at pictures of hot girls that he can't have. They were mostly from his old high school, and they were hot as hell, living the glamorous Instagram life. Well, he could at least masturbate to the new scene with Danny D and Aletta Ocean and their Overwatch cosplay. As he was getting ready, the annoying super loud \"Match Found\" sound has popped up and he clicked accept. Aletta can wait. Sven can't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Games before role queue were stressing even before the game started. You could never be sure that you can play the role that you liked. He made sure that he gets to play Sven by firstpicking him and refusing to roll for the carry role. After he firstpicked Sven, he obviously told his teammates what they should pick. John didn't care that the hard support guy is not in the mood for Crystal Maiden. John ordered him to pick Crystal Maiden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then something very strange happened. The Hard Support player has indeed picked Crystal Maiden, but there was something very unsettling about her voice. It was a disturbed voice of an older woman, with damaged vocal cords. He told John, that the time has come for his punishment. **In Exactly 1000 days, he will be cursed with physically painful, brain lobotomizing dreams every single night, for his every mistake that he didn't accept or when he blamed others**. Crystal Maiden didn't speak a single word after.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game basically ended faster than it has started. John didn't buy a BKB on Sven, he didn't land a single autoattack in his ultimate. He played against 3 stuns and 2 slows. He farmed for 30 minutes, died without buyback and the enemy ended the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the game ended, he remembered the old woman's voice. He laughed it off. It was surely some voice modifying software. Has to be. Right? Well, no. As it turned, the curse was real a real nightmare, just like a Hard Support Pudge that misses every single hook and blames you for not carrying the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "1000 days have passed and the dreams have started.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very simple. As John fell asleep, he felt paralyzed. He was sleeping, but it felt like he is awake. He was conscious. In his dream, he was completely tied to a chair and couldn't move an inch. He was barefoot, and barehanded. He could speak and he could see. Oh how he wished he couldn't. The room was dark, all he could see was a big TV screen with Dota main menu. And his profile logged in. He was surprised that someone could log-in on his account in a random place. He was scared for his Dota inventory. As it turned out, it should have been the least of his concerns. He wasn't uncomfortable. The chair he was sitting in seemed comfortable. It was a brand new Secret Lab chair. But he was bored, and scared. He was sitting there for about twenty minutes, when he heard some sickly coughing. He couldn't see that part of the room, it was dark and there was no particular smell. He could have guessed that it's a human being by the cough and the sound of breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello John. I'm here to fulfill the curse. Said the dark figure with a sickly, damaged voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "John recognized the sound of the vocal cords.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the Crystal Maiden player that supposedly used some sound altering software. Except there was no software. It was the old hag. The curse was real. He was dreaming awake. He felt every sensation in his body. And the worse was about to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hag didn't speak too much. She grabbed a mouse, it was a Zowie EC1. It was stained with grease, and the logo was half scratched off from all the usage. She found a game that John has lost and proceeded to download the replay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curse was simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "She forced John to watch the game from his own perspective and whenever big mistakes came up, she slowed the replay to 0,5x speed so John can see it very well, so John can face his own failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "John was playing Anti Mage and he was in his jungle. The enemy smoked, but one of the opponents killed John's observer ward, so it was obvious. But John kept farming. He got ganked and said : \"Omg, shit supports. No ward. Get cancer piece of shit\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hag played the scene over and over on 0,5x speed. John was forced to look. Everytime the scene ended and John message popped up, the hag tried to cut of one of John fingers on his legs. It was really hard to cut, because the knife was dull and rusty. So sometimes the hag would just smash John's fingers with the hilt of the knife, then she would try to cut it again. Then she played the Antimage scene again, John watched and she was mutilating him. He was in immeasurable pain. He was crying, screaming, drooling from his mouth like a little piece of shit he is. A typical toxic blaming piece of shit.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he watched the scene 10 times and he lost all of his fingers, the dream ended for that night and he woke up. He was nauseous, he puked many times, could barely walk, he had his fingers but he was afraid to look down. The only thing he could do to forget was what he always does when he tries to escape form reality. Dota.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was strange. His teammate missed a spell, he was about to press enter to open chat, but his finger started hurting. He stopped. He swallowed his saliva and kept on playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He couldn't escape from the night. As he fell asleep, the terror once again started. He was watching different scenes all over and over. Destroying his own items because his pos5 Kotl killed a creepweave, him playing Lion in some other game when he used Finger for killsteal only so that he missed mana 15 seconds after when they could kill a core with it. Missing lasthits all around, dying outside of base without buybacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever his chat messages popped up, the hag took some fingers. Sometimes she would get bored and puncture his fingers under the nails with a sharp object, or would cut parts of his tongue and feed him. The hag loved John's chat messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one way to end the terror, and it was saying the following words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no MMR hell. There is no forced winrate. My account is not cursed and it's not in some sorf of a shadow pool. If any top MMR player took my account, they would boost it up in no time. I am where I belong. I shouldn't flame people on my rank because I have played this game for 5000 hours and I'm still on their rank. It's not because of them. w33ha wouldn't care. w33ha got to top1 leaderboards by randoming heroes. W33ha can carry a bad team. If I want to get MMR I need to play better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After some nights, the terror has stopped. There was no dream. There were no nightmares.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he lost the following Dota game, his first reflex was to flame. But then he remembered. He has made at least 50 mistakes that game, if not more. Had he made less mistakes, he surely would have won. He has to make less mistakes. It is how he will grow as a player. Not by blaming others.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the rest of the story. John is now a 6000 player, he still has space to improve. He knows he makes mistakes. He doesn't flame anyone, because he knows that he could also be flamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The legend says that the hag still terrorizes miserable pieces of shit that blame others for their long-term MMR.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't flame in your next game. We are all humans, we try our best. Even Messi misses penalties, even Warren Buffet has losing trades. If our teammate has destroyed his items, it means he needs mental help and probably has a very disturbed life. Don't feel angry about him, rather feel sorry for him and offer him your help and forgiveness. And don't forget, you MMR is the most precise representative of your skill level. If you deserve more than 3000, then you should be able to comfortably beat 3000 MMR players. If you think your team is holding you back, give your account to Yatoro. He could win with carry Crystal Maiden in 3000 MMR if he wanted to. A tilted teammate that destroyed items in one game, or an intentional feeder in the other is not the reason you are not satisfied with your long-term MMR.\n",

      "The story of a boy and a fixed 50% winrate. / Part 3 - FinalThere is something I haven't told you about John. I'm not sure why have I left it out before. This event was the trigger that forced John to change his attitude and how he looks at the game. \n",
      "\n",
      " The events that you are about to read, happened long before John met Yatoro.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a typical day in John's life. The night before when he went to bed, he promised himself that next day he will be productive and that the first the he will do in the morning is to sit down and study for a few hours and clean his room. He promised himself that he won't play Dota the next day. It's no surprise that the first thing he actually did in the morning was a nice game of Dota. The best thing you can do to wake up and kickstart your day is a game of Dota, right? Turns out it wasn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that there was no rolequeue when this happened. John started Dota, clicked the Find Match button and the clock started ticking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before the game started, he knew he was going to play Sven. He was in the mood for Sven. He wanted to AFK farm and oneshot people with a crit. His life was dominating him. So he wanted to dominate others. He didn't care about a good team composition or natural pick orders with supports picking first. He wanted to pick carry and play Sven. There is forced 50% winrate anyway, he thought. So why not?\n",
      "\n",
      "While the system was searching for a game, he was scrolling trough Facebook and Instagram, looking at pictures of hot girls that he can't have. They were mostly from his old high school, and they were hot as hell, living the glamorous Instagram life. Well, he could at least masturbate to the new scene with Danny D and Aletta Ocean and their Overwatch cosplay. As he was getting ready, the annoying super loud \"Match Found\" sound has popped up and he clicked accept. Aletta can wait. Sven can't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Games before role queue were stressing even before the game started. You could never be sure that you can play the role that you liked. He made sure that he gets to play Sven by firstpicking him and refusing to roll for the carry role. After he firstpicked Sven, he obviously told his teammates what they should pick. John didn't care that the hard support guy is not in the mood for Crystal Maiden. John ordered him to pick Crystal Maiden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then something very strange happened. The Hard Support player has indeed picked Crystal Maiden, but there was something very unsettling about her voice. It was a disturbed voice of an older woman, with damaged vocal cords. He told John, that the time has come for his punishment. **In Exactly 1000 days, he will be cursed with physically painful, brain lobotomizing dreams every single night, for his every mistake that he didn't accept or when he blamed others**. Crystal Maiden didn't speak a single word after.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game basically ended faster than it has started. John didn't buy a BKB on Sven, he didn't land a single autoattack in his ultimate. He played against 3 stuns and 2 slows. He farmed for 30 minutes, died without buyback and the enemy ended the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the game ended, he remembered the old woman's voice. He laughed it off. It was surely some voice modifying software. Has to be. Right? Well, no. As it turned, the curse was real a real nightmare, just like a Hard Support Pudge that misses every single hook and blames you for not carrying the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "1000 days have passed and the dreams have started.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very simple. As John fell asleep, he felt paralyzed. He was sleeping, but it felt like he is awake. He was conscious. In his dream, he was completely tied to a chair and couldn't move an inch. He was barefoot, and barehanded. He could speak and he could see. Oh how he wished he couldn't. The room was dark, all he could see was a big TV screen with Dota main menu. And his profile logged in. He was surprised that someone could log-in on his account in a random place. He was scared for his Dota inventory. As it turned out, it should have been the least of his concerns. He wasn't uncomfortable. The chair he was sitting in seemed comfortable. It was a brand new Secret Lab chair. But he was bored, and scared. He was sitting there for about twenty minutes, when he heard some sickly coughing. He couldn't see that part of the room, it was dark and there was no particular smell. He could have guessed that it's a human being by the cough and the sound of breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello John. I'm here to fulfill the curse. Said the dark figure with a sickly, damaged voice. \n",
      "\n",
      "John recognized the sound of the vocal cords.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the Crystal Maiden player that supposedly used some sound altering software. Except there was no software. It was the old hag. The curse was real. He was dreaming awake. He felt every sensation in his body. And the worse was about to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hag didn't speak too much. She grabbed a mouse, it was a Zowie EC1. It was stained with grease, and the logo was half scratched off from all the usage. She found a game that John has lost and proceeded to download the replay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curse was simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "She forced John to watch the game from his own perspective and whenever big mistakes came up, she slowed the replay to 0,5x speed so John can see it very well, so John can face his own failure. \n",
      "\n",
      "John was playing Anti Mage and he was in his jungle. The enemy smoked, but one of the opponents killed John's observer ward, so it was obvious. But John kept farming. He got ganked and said : \"Omg, shit supports. No ward. Get cancer piece of shit\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hag played the scene over and over on 0,5x speed. John was forced to look. Everytime the scene ended and John message popped up, the hag tried to cut of one of John fingers on his legs. It was really hard to cut, because the knife was dull and rusty. So sometimes the hag would just smash John's fingers with the hilt of the knife, then she would try to cut it again. Then she played the Antimage scene again, John watched and she was mutilating him. He was in immeasurable pain. He was crying, screaming, drooling from his mouth like a little piece of shit he is. A typical toxic blaming piece of shit. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he watched the scene 10 times and he lost all of his fingers, the dream ended for that night and he woke up. He was nauseous, he puked many times, could barely walk, he had his fingers but he was afraid to look down. The only thing he could do to forget was what he always does when he tries to escape form reality. Dota. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was strange. His teammate missed a spell, he was about to press enter to open chat, but his finger started hurting. He stopped. He swallowed his saliva and kept on playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He couldn't escape from the night. As he fell asleep, the terror once again started. He was watching different scenes all over and over. Destroying his own items because his pos5 Kotl killed a creepweave, him playing Lion in some other game when he used Finger for killsteal only so that he missed mana 15 seconds after when they could kill a core with it. Missing lasthits all around, dying outside of base without buybacks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever his chat messages popped up, the hag took some fingers. Sometimes she would get bored and puncture his fingers under the nails with a sharp object, or would cut parts of his tongue and feed him. The hag loved John's chat messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one way to end the terror, and it was saying the following words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no MMR hell. There is no forced winrate. My account is not cursed and it's not in some sorf of a shadow pool. If any top MMR player took my account, they would boost it up in no time. I am where I belong. I shouldn't flame people on my rank because I have played this game for 5000 hours and I'm still on their rank. It's not because of them. w33ha wouldn't care. w33ha got to top1 leaderboards by randoming heroes. W33ha can carry a bad team. If I want to get MMR I need to play better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After some nights, the terror has stopped. There was no dream. There were no nightmares.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he lost the following Dota game, his first reflex was to flame. But then he remembered. He has made at least 50 mistakes that game, if not more. Had he made less mistakes, he surely would have won. He has to make less mistakes. It is how he will grow as a player. Not by blaming others.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the rest of the story. John is now a 6000 player, he still has space to improve. He knows he makes mistakes. He doesn't flame anyone, because he knows that he could also be flamed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The legend says that the hag still terrorizes miserable pieces of shit that blame others for their long-term MMR.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't flame in your next game. We are all humans, we try our best. Even Messi misses penalties, even Warren Buffet has losing trades. If our teammate has destroyed his items, it means he needs mental help and probably has a very disturbed life. Don't feel angry about him, rather feel sorry for him and offer him your help and forgiveness. And don't forget, you MMR is the most precise representative of your skill level. If you deserve more than 3000, then you should be able to comfortably beat 3000 MMR players. If you think your team is holding you back, give your account to Yatoro. He could win with carry Crystal Maiden in 3000 MMR if he wanted to.\n",

The first peoples of these frozen wastes would fall prey to possession by these northern wind spirits. Those possessed would remain in an undying and perpetually malnourished state, forever hungry. The natives of this region held to strict traditions in order to evade these spirits and deal with the Windigo -- those possessed by ravenous spirits. \n",

      "All the men in a small indigenous fishing village had been recruited for war against the settlers. The daughter of the village chief, a skilled hunter, was left in charge. One day while out on a hunting trip, the chief's daughter and her two companions got caught out in a sudden unexpected blizzard. The three decided to hunker down and wait out the storm. During the night the chief's daughter was visited by spirits within the storm in her dreams. The spirits showed her images of a band of raiding settlers headed toward her village. The desperation and fear of the young woman were used by the spirits to elicit a deal -- they would provide her with the strength to protect her people if she provided them access to her body. The next afternoon the girl awoke in a mental haze, alone out in the still raging snowstorm, and covered in blood. She then remembered her people, and rushed home. Unfortunately her arrival was too late. Bodies of her tribe were scattered through the village. At the sight of the bodies the girl became desperately hungry and to her horror she began devouring the dead flesh of her people. Weeping as she tore through muscle and sinew, her hunger and rage towards the settlers only grew. Once the village was clean of bodies and covered in new snow, the woman set off to enact her vengeance. The wrath of Kiwetenwi the Windigo continues to this day, bringing with her a perpetual winter.\n",

      "The story of a boy and a fixed 50% winrate. / Part 2Months have passed since John has met Yatoro. He still misses the bald guy with the white mask on his face. The way he carried games, the way he avoided ganks, the way he farmed and joined fights at the same time, he can never forget that.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried to replicate what Yatoro did many times. But he always had bad teammates. Not like Yatoro. Yatoro always has good teammates, even when he played John's account. Everything was easier for Yatoro. His team stacked for him, pulled for him, warded for him, gave him the best neutral items and they never flamed Yatoro. When John plays, the team is bad, teammates flame and they feed. When Yatoro won 39 out of 40 games on John's account, it was lucky team and enemy had feeders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enemy offlaners are so bad when they play vs Yatoro. When John plays safelane, enemy is always a godlike smurf.\n",
      "\n",
      "These thought gave John peace. He knew that his winrate is not affected by his own skill level. Games are decided by his teammates, enemy smurfs, bad and good drafts. Whatever he does in his game don't matter. The system will force 50% winrate on him. He could sleep well with these thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was fine for John, he still played Does, flamed his teammates when he was feeling bad about himself. After bad games he would masturbate, but this was a problem now because he couldn't pause the games at start so things got messy from time to time. When he won games, he typed gg ez but he hated himself coz he knew that get got carried. All in all, it was a typical Dota period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until one thing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aliens hijacked (stole) his family. Aliens told him he has to raise his MMR by 2000 points in 3 months, or the whole family would be massacred. The condition was that he has to play on his own account without help during ranked games.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, John was shocked. Aliens? Dota MMR? What the actual fuck? - He thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible to raise MMR anyway. There is a forced winrate of 50%. It's impossible to climb MMR anyway. Valve and Gaben made sure of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried playing his best, but he kept losing because of bad teammates (he thought). He blamed the team, the boosters, the smurfs, everything but himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would have been okay in normal conditions, but the Aliens didn't care about these things. They will masacre his family if he doesn't increase his MMR by 2000 points in 3 months. The conditions were clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he lost 120 MMR that day, he started crying. He wasn't angry. He was scared and helpless.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept crying and begging for the help of god. He was lost. The night was silent as death, cold as the heart of my ex, dark as the darkest night.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment he stopped breathing. Someone opened the front door and said:  Привіт брате!  (Hello brother!)\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the bald guy with the white mask. It was Yatoro. Yes the TI winner. Fucking Yatoro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't ask me how, but he has heard the story, and he was here to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "He promised John that he will help him to get his family back. John will be coached by Yatoro. He will gain 2120 MMR. (120 that he lost + 2000 Alien MMR).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now everything was in the hands of our hero,\n",
      "\n",
      "They started with watching some if his games. Yatoro was writing stuff in this notebook. He wasn't commenting anything yet. They have watched around 10 replays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yatoro wrote down around 100 mistakes that he noticed here. He didn't want to go deeper into details, because John would get lost. So he started correcting these 100 mistakes first.\n",
      "\n",
      "John was shocked. He made mistakes? Wasn't it his team that made him lose? He actually made mistakes? He was baffled.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first few days, they played only normal games with Yatoro palying pos5 while John was plasying pos1. John kept learning. This was very hard for him, because Yatoro was teaching him to ignore teammates and focus on himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "They learned micro positioning in lanes, mana management, courier usage efficiency, optimal starting items and buildups, item choice depending on teammates and opponents, timings, micro and macro decisions, bkb usage, when is it bad to go for bkb, when it it necessary, manta dodging, lane aggro control, map control, playing around vision, playing from behind, playing from the advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long process of 30 days. There were 138 mistakes, 73 suggestions and 130 general tips written down in the notebook. John was amazed. Games became a lot easier. He could anticipate what will happen, he knew how to react in-game and outside of the game. He knew win conditions, he started to play around timings. He knew what opponents want to do so he easily avoided being killed without having impact.\n",
      "\n",

      "Craziest game I've playedI never post here but I just can't get this one game off my mind, this is after nearly 2k hours of gameplay. I wanted to share, brag, complain, suggest based on what ended up being one of the craziest game I played last night.\n",
      "\n",
      "It started with everyone putting markers in the lanes. I went safelane and so did my lane partner. He picked sniper and thus ensued the chat on what his intentions are. He said repeatedly that he was a \"position 4\" (I know it's doesn't make sense for safelane) sniper when I asked if I should go support. After he insisted again, I picked wraith king because I felt that I'd get really good ranged harass to last hit and and could use the stun to supplement the weakness of a sniper support if they went on us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We end up getting dumpstered in the lane in exactly the way you'd think a support sniper would get owned. The warlock/dawnbreaker combo just deeply shut down this sniper, who was sitting behind me. He kept pushing the lane with his shrapnel instead of harassing with right clicks and was out of position sitting behind me so the warlock just kept casting w on him. He never pulled to compensate for his shrapnel and was thus more exposed as a result of his actions. As soon as the little regen he bought was exhausted, the dawn then came in aggressively and forced us both out of the lane. It became clear he was not attempting to support but to \"dual carry\" by taking some last hits, spending very little on support items, and waiting for me to leave so he could take solo xp and farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I went in for a last hit I'd lose half my life, even with my E skilled to guarantee the last hit. I decided to jungle at level 3 and let the sniper have the lane. It was miserable, you need at least 4-5 levels to be a viable jungler as WK and for the first 10-15 mins I was lagging the entire team in levels by a significant amount. The other team was ganking heavily and our mid lion and pos 4 CM were caught on their back foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sniper decided that this was his chance to be the carry he said he wasn't going to be and started building damage items. They were constantly chasing me around the jungle and I was barely gaining levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "I managed to still get a pretty fast radiance after the op team made a strategic mistake and abandoned the lane they \"won\" and went with a farm centric build (maybe a mistake given early game?) and switch to a utility/tank WK instead of my normal damage build. I built A/C faster than normal for defense/survivability, built Sange into Yasha instead of damage items and then upgraded to overwhelming blink for lockdown and stats. The opp disable and slow heavy build (warlock, dawnbreaker, winter wyvern, CK) was locking things down hard and the warlock would just double rock me whenever I showed up to fights and team fighting was just really hard even with one of the most survivable players in the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "We eventually started to win some fights with good positioning but were still on the back foot. The sniper was doing well because I changed to utility and could lock down their back line with a ton of survivability when I took focus. Whenever we had the advantage, we'd do something stupid though; sniper would run up to their tier 3 and get picked off and I did the same when I thought my team was going in. They eventually regrouped and managed to push to tier 4s and take them down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, we won the fight as they were hitting our ancient. They had used all their spells and we bought back and killed them all, almost losing when the catapaults kept hitting ancient while we were chasing down their last player. We drove up mid and had a 5v2, killed them as they respawned, and ended the game just as they were all respawning. It was the closest game I've been a part of and felt so much better because of everything that happened early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeaways:\n",
      "\n",
      "* People spend way too much time experimenting with setups in pubs these days. We had three \"experimental\" roles at the same time but it's literally every game for me now. It usually fails in exactly the ways you expect and it just ruins the game for everyone\n",
      "* People grief in ways that are actually self-reinforcing. The sniper felt like he was the hero and will probably be motivated to build like this again, despite the fact that he was only rescued by the fact that others happened to have done the opposite and could switch from core to support easily. In the post-game, he had muted everyone and gotten at least four griefing reports and still was saying \"I bet you're glad I built damage items now\"\n",
      "* It feels amazing to turn a game around and itemize well situationally. I'm just getting to the point where I don't build 75% the same items no matter what the game and while I probably could've done better (maybe a bkb instead of sange?) it still felt good to be able to swap into a completely different build than I thought I'd be doing and see it work out.\n",
      "* People don't play well when they are losing. It took so much of my effort to convince our team to not fight and run away even if it meant losing one player. They kept trying to teamfight and run at somebody instead of split pushing and hitting towers to force rotations and take initiative.\n",
      "* Never give up! Even in the worst of circumstances you're facing either a tough opp lineup that falls off, people can make mistakes that equalize, and at least in the lower MMR nobody punishes as much as they should so you can catch up and split push much more effectively if you know how to play from behind.\n",
      "* Party queueing is so much more common now than it used to be and it's annoying for a solo-queuer. On one hand it's nice that the game is becoming more social, but it really locks out people who aren't in parties. Often the parties are in a discord and don't comm with the rest of the team and they also just decide to lane together and lock out the rest of the team. Sniper was not in the three stack on our team and neither was I. However, it blocked our ability to lane swap when things went badly and he was complaining the three stack was ragging on him because they were paired. While this does happen to me and I empathize, it didn't actually apply; he was actually griefing. It also creates way more variation in skill leading to bad matchmaking. I'd like a strict solo for pubs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There. It's off my chest. Dota 2 is a great game, but because it relies on teamwork often with strangers can be so frustrating some times. When you can overcome despite the odds it makes it all worthwhile, but it's so much more fun when you don't have to overcome and can just hit a good stride with a team and the only challenge is the skill and draft of the opps, not the forced errors on your own team's skill and draft.

The reasoning for this is Bottle no longer maintaining fountain refill once you leave the fountain, therefore losing its value dramatically.\n",

      "\n",
      "Key component in this playstyle is abusing Travels every time it's off cooldown. Default scenario is spending most of your mana on a pickoff/teamfight, then teleporting back. After \\~10 seconds you're ready to leave base via short zip and walk towards next area of interest - this results in \\~20 seconds downtime after teleporting back to base, and after that you're ready to zip again. This completely negates the mana regen component of Storm's playstyle from previous patches. We're going all-in on our damage output.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the game is going passive, and your team is comfortable just farming instead of skirmishing (i.e. late game carry), you can also spend your mana rotating to/from more-dangerous-to-farm-lane-creeps into nearby camps, or vice versa, always ending in teleporting back once your mana is spent.\n",
      "\n",

Fortunately, by that point we're midway to our next item - BKB. The thing about this particular Storm playstyle, is we acquire powerspikes very rapidly. Min\\~10 travels, min \\~15 shard, min \\~20 Bkb. Once you are no longer comfortable with pickoffs, you switch to farm mode, once again shoving dangerous waves and farming away from your carry using your superior mobility via travels. Once Bkb is ready, you are once again back in action, no longer afraid of any disables, able to comfortably remove most targets during upcoming skirmishes. As a bonus, our four Nulls we've been holding on to have now doubled in power by min 25 - even further expanding our kill potential.\n",

      "\n",
      "The only difference is as enemies get more tools to survive, you continuously increase your damage output. Our next item is Orchid, usually arriving by min 30. Only now do we sell our first Null. Next we will upgrade our Orchid to Bloodthorn - this let's you pickoff most \\~2k hp targets, provided they are not saved by teammates or Aeon.\n",

      "This build culminates in a Moonshard pickup.

      "Some info and tidbits from a podcast from earlier today featuring FlyFly was on a podcast with other Israeli e-sports players earlier today ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l-RLADiUgs) \\- they talk in Hebrew)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's some of the things he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- He currently lives in NA\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- He received several offers and is in-between teams\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- He still plans on playing professionally. Mentions he recently coached TSM but didn't really like being a coach, could be because it's the wrong time for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- 'Says it's difficult to know till' what point you can play and  Dota probably won't live forever and at some point there will be less people playing and money involved. he plans on pursing a career in e-sports as it's only just starting and still evolving and there's a lot of options\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Asked about notail, says there's a story, history and friendship there ('less so now', probably meaning none), prefers not to talk about it again as he recently talked about it on a different podcast and its personal\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Becoming a pro is a hard choice to make. You have to sacrifice everything in order to succeed, and you have to know you actually have the talent for it. Not everyone can be a pro just like not everyone can be an NBA player.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- He doesn't consider himself a fan of any particular player, but he respects a lot of players and says you can learn something from any player you've played with and experienced something with. He learned something from every player he played it and wants to constantly learn and evolve as a person and as a player.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Having a relationship (partner) can be difficult at the start as you probably don't know how to manage your time, but he's had a girlfriend for over 8 years and having another person to support you is helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Mentioned starting out as a HoN player, says he got into e-sports when someone offered him to play for an amateur team and that person happened to work for Fnatic\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Says that when he started he had no intention of becoming an e-sports player since prize pools were something like $1k or a laptop (around 2010)\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- When they started (at Fnatic?) their salary was around $300. The highest amount they were paid at Fnatic was around $3-4k\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- The biggest jump in salary was when he got into EG. He can't disclose details because it's recent but it was much higher than Fnatic\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Salaries in Dota can fluctuate a lot, you can make a lot of money or very little. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\- There's EU teams that offer as much money as NA teams (might have been talking specifically about EG?)\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Says he doesn't feel like moving from HoN and becoming a good player was hard since they are both the same genre. Says it would be like him moving from Dota to LoL, it would take him a few months to a year to become a really good player.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Says he never felt pressure financially and was always winning enough to live comfortably\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Most important things for an e-sports player are talent, work ethic, being able to look at yourself before judging others which most people fail to do. In public games where you lost and people blame each other, he first thinks about what he did wrong and only then thinks about other things. Also, you need to be someone who people can work with. He had experiences playing with people he didn't enjoy playing with. You see it in tournaments, where someone might say something that was out of place (paraphrasing) and all of a sudden you start having doubts about the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Everyone handles losing differently, but e-sports players at a high level can generally maintain their emotions since you lose all the time, even in pub games, and you often lose a lot more than you win since tournaments can have a lot of teams and only the 1st place wins, reaching second place is still losing. He generally takes some time before looking at replays and looks at it without involving emotions, thinks of what he could've done better and then what the team could've done better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- You constantly have to evolve and keep an open mind. New players are coming in all the time and they are generally younger than you are.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- He doesn't have a certain pose or way to sit, but he played with players that find it really important.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- You have to maintain your body and eat healthy, and it's better to start off early. Dota players are generally older and he knows players that have back and elbow (think he meant wrist?) problems, and some that can't play because of that anymore. Says you don't really know for how long you can play as an e-sports player as it's not strictly a physical sport. He's 29 and feels great, and has been exercising daily and eating healthy for 8-10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Dota drastically changes between patches. No game is ever the same and you have to keep learning. When there's a new patch teams start making new strategies but as time goes on teams start playing similar to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Someone asks about Ana and says he heard he's famous for playing his role very differently than others and that it changed things in Dota. Fly says Ana played more aggressive than other people in his role. Asked if people tried to copy Ana, he says people tried to copy him as is often the case where there's someone who wins and people decide they want to learn from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Says he loves the pressure in tournaments and that he feels playing in-front of a crowd and on a stage makes him play better. Playing from home is a different game to playing in-front of a crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- One of the peaks of his career is winning the Manila Major. Having Hodor open the doors was crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- One of the low points of his career was losing at TI6(or TI5?) where they were favorites and they had a really bad loss. Says he's usually a very calm person but he was mad at himself and wanted to punch something but a camera was following him.\n",

      "Damage, Items, and the Evolution of a Game: A Thesis on the Design Philosophy of Modern LeagueHey y'all, it's your boy tormentedlol here, once again posting a 5 year long essay on the game. There's a tl;dr at the bottom if you don't wanna read a whole article. Just wanted to post some thoughts I had on the game before Patch 12.10 hits. Ultimately, the point of this post is to invite a discussion on the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction:**  \n",
      "When mentioning the words *League of Legends* to any online gaming enthusiast, the response received is often a mixture of exasperation, revile, and appreciation, mixed with a healthy dose of nostalgia. It is the game that you visit this subreddit for, it is a game millions of people have sunk hundreds to thousands of hours into, and it is a game that has endured for almost a decade and a half from Alpha to the upcoming Durability Patch. It is also a game that houses contentious back and forths amongst many of its supporters and haters over both the minutiae and bigger pictures of game mechanics. Throughout the undeniably short yet also undeniably long tenure of the game, League has evolved from a simple derivative of DotA to a game that independently stands out in its own right. Inevitably, this gradual transition has not been without its ups and downs. Ask any staunch veterans about the horrors of Season 2 and 3 Kassadin and they may yet still lapse into a thousand-yard stare of 2.6-second silences and Riftwalks longer than Caitlyn's auto attack range. Perhaps they'll tell you about the time a rabid Smurf with a glowing hammer marked their support for death only to run a train on the other 4 members of the team over an eternity of 8 seconds. Or perhaps they'll tell you about the strategic nuances of a bygone era, the vision wars, the revolution that the arrival of the Koreans gave in Season 2, or perhaps even the whisperings of the Europeans inventing the modern mid-lane meta. Indeed, League has seen its days - better or worse - but what I want to discuss in this article is the fundamental underpinnings of a game that has endured for a majority of this generation's coming of age - the strife it causes, the desires of the developers, and the plague of the common player.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Identity Crisis of the Early Game:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To call early League of Legends a mess is an understatement. Those with rose-tinted lenses over the bygone eras of Beta through to Season 2 are fast to forget the many fundamental issues of the time simply because it was in their \"better days\". Before the meta had been thoroughly established and before you could hop on one of many dozens of sites to provide advanced analytics - back when the best resource you could find was a dubious writeup posted on SoloMid or MOBAFire - League was a broken game: a glorious, but nightmarishly balanced mess that catered to the absolute extremes of player experience. It was a game inundated with non-interactive kits that lacked theme and cohesion, extremely punishing resource costs for commitment to abilities, and most of all, a general lack of understanding of optimization. The Wild West of the early days saw monstrosities like an Evelynn who could stun you from anywhere without the slightest warning, Rengar ultimates that allowed him to simply walk alongside you without your knowledge, choosing his earliest convenience to pounce, and games that seemed to stagnate and go on forever due to a lack of decisive objectives and a wealth of powerful waveclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a new game, and yet an old game - one that took the foundations of DotA and transported them to a different setting. This origin from DotA is something that continues to haunt the older generation of players to this day. And that is because old League of Legends was simply not the same game as the current one. In those grayscale times, DotA was a legitimate competitor in popularity and the main difference League catered towards was ease of access. Extremely esoteric and punishing mechanics with high learning curves such as elevation, turn speed, camp stacking, denial, tree pathing, etc were all abandoned within the early days of development for a more streamlined experience. But because the root of League was still in the style of Dota, that meant not all of the things came over fixed. You still had janky kits with prohibitively high-costing skills that limited lane trading, supports that mirrored the position 5 of DotA in terms of poverty at high levels of play, and end game abilities that could seemingly suck the life and soul out due to how long they could potentially disable your character.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in this early phase of the game where a lot of the more grizzled and disillusioned veterans come from, lamenting the loss of what they tie to their childhood. Nostalgia, after all, is a powerful drug that rights all wrongs. And, as somebody who played in those days, League was genuinely fun back then. But not because it was a well-balanced game, but because I played without even remotely caring about balance in the first place. Early League was an exploration, a journey, a discovery to unlock champions and learn new things. These are things that no matter what the patch notes say, cannot be regained. \n",
      "\n",
      "**The Rise of the Professional Scene and League's Loss of Innocence**\n",
      "\n",
      "In its nascency, the problems highlighted above never presented too overbearing of an issue to a playerbase that was still stretching its legs. But once Riot Games and, the world saw the popular appeal the game had, its potential for even further growth, and the enormous market of professional sporting that it could tap into, that's when things started becoming more serious. And with more serious looks at the game came more serious changes. Perhaps this is when it all started going downhill for players who now spend their days bitterly complaining about their lost youth - when the game lost its innocence and luster for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end of Season 2 into Season 3 are landmark years for League of Legends. Season 2 Worlds, and its enormous showing (at the time) proved just how viral the video game had gone from its first championship played in a Dreamhack hosted by Phreak's basement. Season 3 saw the integration of professional regional leagues over major markets in EULCS and NALCS. This game could make it to the big times. But the troubles of growth in esports are significantly different from the troubles of growth in traditional sports. The root is in accessibility. There is this firm idealogy, unlike in any other professional sport, where players of an online game can put themselves in the shoes of a professional in a way that cannot be emulated by the likes of football or basketball. I will never be tall enough to play in the NBA, or skillful enough to compete in UEFA, but League of Legends? That I can download right now. And if I play enough, and climb high enough on a public ladder, maybe people will notice me. Maybe a team will sign me. It is that dream that keeps the gamer going for most sports played professionally. The desire, and the visibility of an untapped potential to be good or great.\n",
      "\n",
      "To cater to this market of hopefuls wishing to become Faker before even Faker played his first OGN, Riot slowly began trimming the fat around the edges of the game that made, what in their minds, the game unfun or noninteractive. Mana costs started going down to favour more dynamic laning patterns, flashier champions were released to attract new fans, and entire kits were remade in the name of cohesion and balance. To avoid the horrific experience of playing position 5 in DotA, Riot introduced multiple mechanics to make support more enjoyable at both higher and lower parts of the play, they began paying close attention to what professionals were abusing to win games, and for the first time, the separation of the average player and the pro player started widening (and I'm not bashing on DotA here, DotA2 has tried much the same in making the average player experience more enjoyable).\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Divide between the Professional and the Casual**\n",
      "\n",
      "The reality of the matter is that to become a professional in League of Legends is just as rare, if not even rarer than to become a professional in traditional sports statistically. The overwhelming majority of players are not even fit to play in the equivalent of a high school division 1 scene, let alone in a professional scene. 98% of NA's player base is below D4, 96% in EUW. Even amongst players that do ever reach Challenger, maybe only 1% of that 0.0001% of the player base lives to see the big stage. Yet this does not discourage people from playing and emulating professionals. Unlike in a game of pickup basketball where the limitations of not being able to dunk certainly will stop me from trying to dunk, lest I hurt myself in a grand humiliating fashion, the unabashed confidence of less skilled players to instantly attempt what they just saw on Twitch or LoL Esports is immeasurable. And this is where the player base starts becoming fragmented - because Riot fundamentally wants players to believe they can do these insane things, while also having to balance the game for its professional scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a reason the NBA, the NFL, the Champions League, etc. don't try to change rules based on the games played in AAU or at the park. It is because they simply don't need to care about complaints against a double rim, a goal that's too wide, or the size of an offensive line formation from those games. But Riot has to because professionals and casuals both represent a spectrum of customers that they want to attract. The professionals because they bring in new players, and the casuals because oftentimes those new players start off as casuals. This presents many of the problems people have begun to have with the modern style of balance because many times, they face a cognitive dissonance between the plays made at Worlds and the plays made in their SoloQ games. You see Ruler 1v4'ing with Aphelios only to have a completely different experience as ADC in SoloQ and that is because ADC is more heavily balanced around professional organized play than it is around SoloQ. \n",
      "\n",
      "These problems come from the simple fact that a group of 5 players represent the 99.999th percentile of skill, all in active communication with one another, and are also playing a different game from those sitting at home. Much like how the old game and the current game are two different universes, the zenith of pro play is simply a different universe as well, even on the same patch. And because balancing certain roles, champions, or identities around playability and favourability in SoloQ can often completely dismantle the competitive integrity at the highest organized level, Riot has to pick and choose favorites.\n",
      "\n",
      "ADC is a prominent example. It is one of, if not the most important role in at least 40% of professional games due to its contribution to damage, siege, and formation. But you certainly wouldn't be able to tell that from playing SoloQ. Lo and behold, ADC players tend to be one of the most outspoken communities when it comes to the balance of their roles, and this isn't really their fault. The ADC role simply isn't balanced at the level of play most casual players play at, regardless of if that's in Ranked or in a Normal, and almost never will be. Certainly not with the lack of voice communication, a role that relies most heavily on interplay and teamwork suffers. And certainly, with a random assortment of teammates, it suffers even more. But give ADC too much agency and the game starts looking more like earlier years where the contributions of other players start to seem to matter less. Perhaps it looks like an Ardent Censer meta where even Faker at what I would argue was the absolute peak of his playing ability in his career, still fell 3-0 to Samsung. Perhaps it looks like Uzi dominantly carrying RYL to Worlds Finals two years in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accessibility, while great at bringing in customers, creates headaches for the balance team that could not be described. Any 30 year old man with a beer belly can play a game of Ranked with the same competitive fire as Caps in LEC finals. But he probably won't play as well as Caps, and he might end up dissatisfied with why his experience simply looks so different.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Riot Has Addressed Balance Over the Years - The Divide Amongst Casual Players**\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, because Riot cannot actively balance their five primary roles and many particular champions without playing favourites between pros and casual, it falls on other tangibles for them to make the game more \"fun and interactive\". This comes in the form of many changes that cater towards more accessible skillsets, especially among younger players as a target demographic, and has led to further divisions in the player base - those that come from the old game and had skills that flourished then, and those that picked up the new game and have skills that flourish in a new system. \n",
      "\n",
      "The old DotA structure of League was significantly more rigid with straightforward items and duels that were glorified and prolonged stat checks. Many Legendary items simply represented efficient swaths of a bunch of stats or gave them through an aura. Force of Nature was a massive ball of HP5 and Magic Resist, Will of the Ancients just gave everyone AP and Spell Vamp, Bloodthirster gave 100 AD and 25% Lifesteal, the list goes on. Another feature was that often the upper echelon of items like Infinity Edge, Deathcap and BT were prohibitively expensive while giving significantly more stats than they do now, while other items were incredibly undercosted. Thornmail gave 100 armor flat for an extremely low price tag, and yet was also very rarely bought, while Last Whisper gave 45 AD and 35% Armor Penetration for, at one point, the price of 2080 gold. Some items were also hilariously broken despite being rarely abused - an outlier coming to mind is old Lich Bane having a 1.0 AP ratio\n",
      "\n",
      "So the question then becomes if the stats were so much higher, why does the damage feel lower from back then, and the answer is rather straightforward and threefold.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Gold generation is significantly higher than it was back in those days.* \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Comparing a professional game from S2 or S3 to a professional game from now, teams are on average 4-5k gold wealthier than before by 15 minutes. This often represents the difference of an item completion and the gap only grows as the game goes longer due to jungle camps respawning faster and giving more gold, turret plating, and higher ambient gold. This is most noticeable in the Support role, where a good pace to be at by 15 in S3 would have been Sightstone + Boots. This touches back into making roles feel more interactive - supports that have more gold will feel more useful and want to play the game more. The same is true for junglers, who back in the earlier years of League, mostly functioned as secondary supports and now can be fully functional carries. The logic behind these changes makes sense, and in my mind, is good for the game. Players are simply more likely to play a game where they feel more agency, and not being able to buy items that aren't wards just isn't particularly fun. This endeavour has also largely been successful as in the earlier years of the game, almost nobody wanted to play as support. Now it is one of the most queued roles\n",
      "2. Adding to the gold discrepancy are Riot's internal buffs towards secondary resource availability. In its early game state, mana regen was significantly lower across the board, skills tended to cost prohibitively larger amounts of mana, and ability rotations were partially balanced around being able to purchase consumable mana potions. Riot has since removed mana potions (allowing for more available gold to purchase) and incorporated higher MP5 stats for almost all champions to promote more interactive play in early game lanes. This ends up creating several consequences further down the line, as more trading means more lopsided matchups, means larger differences in level and income between winning and losing players. Because lower resource management encourages more trading, more kills happen, more plates are taken, etc. The same goes for early game cooldown management for most trading devices - as well as the release of significantly more resourceless champions.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Players are much better at optimizing now than before.*\n",
      "\n",
      "The game has evolved significantly over time, so much so that the Damwon that won 2020 Worlds or the EDG that won 2021 Worlds likely would have wiped the floor with 2015 SKT, a team that is often touted as the most dominant team of all time. The availability of online resources and the ballooning of the pro scene is in part responsible for this, but so too is the simple evolution of desire among gamers to want to be the most efficient. Optimization is the lifeblood of gaming - as seen from DPS calculators in MMOs to speedrunning in general. This is true for League too, where people have become sharper at combos, and more knowledgeable about what items to build. The mechanical skill floor has increased drastically from the days of oo'ing and aah'ing at Insec performing his namesake at All Stars 2013. And faster combos mean lower time to kill. Furthermore, the deluge of available resources to guide player experience is a double-edged sword. While it elevates the average player, it also objectively reduces how much they actually analyze what they're doing -thinking I should build X item because it is meta and not Y item is bad on Z champion being a good example. Analysts like LS have their entire brand on poor itemization choices due to sunken mindsets. A lot of the time, this is represented through a dearth of defensive itemization when playing roles that historically have always spec'd into defensive 6th item choices from the early days of the game (Banshee's Veil and old GA). Building Ninja Tabi on ADC used to be commonplace and now is all but extinct, not necessarily because it is bad (though it can very well be depending on the situation) but simply because it is viewed as *less optimal*. This is in part because doing damage just feels good - why be tankier when I can blow someone up faster? It's more fun to blow people up than it is to survive and deal less damage. \n",
      "\n",
      "*Builds are more streamlined and items focus more on interplay than simple stats.* \n",
      "\n",
      "Most items now give lower stats than they did previously but also incorporate unique passives and actives that are meant to interact with other items and abilities. Shieldbow gives less AD than BT used to, less Crit and AD than IE, and less Attack Speed than old PD, but in exchange gives all of those stats at once, while also incorporating a defensive measure in the build. You would have gotten more *damage* out of building 6 BTs on Riven in all likelihood due to having 600 AD, but it was impractical to do so (well, in all honesty, it probably wasn't that impractical). Riot wants the game to have a unique feel and identity for each experience, and part of that is giving different roles items that help them fulfill their role in the game. This streamlines the building process but also leads to less diversity in stats. ADCs tend to have significantly fewer defensive options, partly because they choose not to build them (see above) but also partly because their defensive options are items that serve offensive dual purposes. The same is true for bruisers with Death's Dance, and tanks with Sunfire Cape.\n",
      "\n",
      "This presents in the form of a higher perception of damage simply because it was trollish to build in a way that promoted only damage in the early days of League, even if it meant you could theoretically do more damage. At the same time, it also makes the game feel more involved. There is nothing fundamentally interesting about somebody buying a 100 Armor Thornmail and making you deal less damage, but there is a clear and cogent decision-making process in building a Randuin's against a team that has a lot of Critical Strike damage. The latter is significantly more satisfying than the former on a mental level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, part of the problem is an unwillingness from the player base to want to adapt to the new style of gameplay, but also because many of these changes are meant to cater towards a better viewing experience in professional play and a better player experience for younger players that don't necessarily want to commit to a game that is built around stat checking. Casual fans that have played this game for many years and seen the gradual shift, however, face a crossroads on whether or not the game is even fundamentally the same. The answer is no, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just also not necessarily a good thing.  The pro players will adapt to changes because it is their occupation but the casuals are left in the dust wondering where the good days went. But the \"good days\" also had to go to keep the game refreshing. At least from the perspective of the company that puts out the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "This discrepancy only magnifies as you climb up the Ranked ladder. Better and better players with higher and higher ambitions think significantly less necessarily about the mouthfeel of the game and will simply play to what is best to win. At the same time, the competitiveness that feels the need to climb is likely either the fire keeping them in love with the game, or sadly, sometimes the torch that fuels an abusive toxic relationship with a game they cannot let go of. In the case of the latter, no amount of balance changes will fix the underlying issue. But the question remains? Where do all the casual longtime players fit in the scheme of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is that they don't for the most part. If players have auspicious desires, they have to get used to how the game has been and will be changing - whether that's in favour of damage or not. If they don't have auspicious desires for climbing in Ranked, then the question becomes why they should have a say in the competitive balance of a game in the first place. And this once again points back towards the divide between casual and pro, but also a divide between casual and hardcore. Not all League players necessarily have a do or die attitude toward winning, but undoubtedly there are some that both want to win to have fun, but also *don't want to adapt* to the changing structure of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, it isn't too rare to see people who play ARAM, a mode that is wholly uncompetitive in terms of balance due to the nature of stacking % increase and damage reductions, also want their fair share of representation in balance patches. The reality is that this is impossible as the constant juggling act Riot has to do between all the different players they have to represent simply has no room for these players either.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an aside, one point I will vehemently oppose, however, is the notion of total *skill reduction* in the meat and potatoes of the game. This is just categorically false at the professional level, where teams have consistently improved and solved the game more and more to prevent even harsher balance challenges for the team. The niceties of the game have simply changed and required different types of skill, but a \"slower game with slower kills\" isn't at all necessarily a more skillful and strategic one. People who solicit such complaints about missing the \"strategy\" of the game from earlier seasons need to realize that the strategy of the game was significantly less developed in the era they were talking about. People who compare old League to Chess need to realize many games of Chess are a game of inches determined by a single move or lapse - much closer to getting one shot for being out of position than it is to some prolonged tactical standoff. Of course, there are also long games, but nobody would say a game of chess took less skill for having taken 40 moves as opposed to 70 moves. I've written extensively on the strategy and positioning behind team fights in pro play, the setups, the timers, etc. and there is never a *lack* of things to analyze at the very least, even though the fights don't last as long. People who can't see the strategy in the game simply aren't looking hard enough /endrant\n",

Personally, I analyze the game because I am fascinated by the intricacies of it, regardless of what the state of durability is, and I would implore others to understand that ultimately, the game is for you to have fun. If you aren't, there is nothing shameful in taking a break until you *do* have fun. I think a lot of players on this subreddit just seem burnt out and bitter a lot of the time and would greatly benefit from taking a break and returning when they can find a passion for the game. Obviously, I'm not trying to shut down all criticism, but I think a lot of the complaint threads about damage creep that have cropped up in the past half-year have lacked critical forethought into the roots of where these problems originate and how we can necessarily solve them so I want to encourage people to examine these things in more depth by just sharing what insight I have.\n",

      "now what would I change to tryndamere kit when he finally gets his Rework, well Riot already addressed the things they won't change from Tryndamere's kit, on which I also Agree, see Tryndamere M.O revolves around having his health low which is why his Ult doesn't give him invulnerability from all attacks, only that he does not go below 1hp which synergizes with his 1st skill passive and his Crit Damage where when Tryndamere is at low health he gains additional Dmg base on his missing health and for Tryndamere Mains we view his 3rd spin CD reduce when Critting integral to his play style.\n",

      "Another response to MSI Format (per JLXP feat. Jatt/Markz)This is my response to the questions by Markz and Jatt about potential changes to the MSI format to respond to critiques.  I apologize for grammar ahead of time as this has been a somewhat stream of consciousness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Jatt and Markz mentioned the following constraints when formatting MSI, so we'll try and consider these when proposing the format:\n",
      "\n",
      "14 days of league broadcast\n",
      "\n",
      "Not reducing viewership (highlighting past IWC)\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "Before looking at potential format options it is important to both consider the current critiques (areas to be improved by format change), and different trade-offs of MSI.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Critiques of current format:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1)  Too many low-stakes games.**  I define a low-stakes game as a game that does not have a significant impact on the greater scheme of the tournament.  These include games played after teams moving on have been decided, as well as games in which the outcome is almost certain, ie. games between minor regions and contenders ie. EU, CN, KR 1 seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2)  Low competitive quality**, as a result of not enough representation of major regions given only two international tournaments a year.  Outside of worlds, we only get to see major region clashes in competitive riot events twice a year.  Only sending one team from the major regions provides a lackluster tournament in terms of competition as there are typically only 2 heavy favorites (KR CN 1st seeds), with one outside favorite (EU 1st seed).  Hosting a tournament that features 12 teams, but typically only 2-3 teams have a &gt;5% chance of winning does not provide a good competitive tournament and creates too many low-stakes games as mentioned above. \n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, when looking at other bracket tournaments like the NCAAM/NCAAW march madness tournaments, teams can generally be broken down into various tiers, the ones we’ll focus on include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Favorites: Teams in which not winning is an underperformance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contenders: Teams that have a low, but realistic chance of winning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark Horses: Teams that can upset contenders and over-perform expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Representatives: These are typically your 13-16 seeds, which have little chance to do any damage in the tournament, but offer a chance for smaller conferences to get exposure.  Typically this is around 25% of the field, these teams can occasionally make a few upsets, but typically don’t get very far. \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, the majority of teams at MSI fall into the Representatives category, with a few of the regions playing dark horses, and there are almost no contenders outside of EU 1 seed.  Ideally, we would want almost an equal breakdown of these categories to provide for a more interesting/competitive tournament. \n",
      "\n",
      "This critique was especially brought to light this year, with RNG’s travel situation.  Many considered the tournament not worthwhile if RNG could not play in the tournament, because that would remove one of the two tournament favorites, leaving only 1 favorite and 1 contender.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MSI Trade-Offs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1) International Minor Region Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Average/Peak Viewership\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Competitive Quality of Matches (Average/Peak)\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, the MSI format weights the tradeoffs in the following manner\n",
      "\n",
      "Representation &gt; Viewership &gt; Competitive Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite providing minor region teams with representation and the opportunity to play against the best in the world, they are forced into primarily low-stakes games and do not have a good chance to progress into the tournament.  Then we have to ask the question, is this the best form of representation for these minor region teams, and is this representation worth the tradeoffs of lower viewership and lower competitive quality of the tournament in general?  \n",
      "\n",
      "I am not trying to be a minor region hater, but I would argue no, it is not in its current state.  Later on, we’ll look into how we can retain/improve minor region representation with high-stakes minor region games.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Proposed MSI changes:**\n",

      "By doing this, we are increasing the number of high-stakes games, and increasing the number of favorites/contenders to roughly half of the field (Multiple KR seeds, Multiple CN seeds, EU 1 seed).  Additionally, we add more dark horses (NA 1-2 seeds, EU 2 seed, VCS 1 seed, PCS 1 seed, Minor Region 1 seed).  This is also important, because then the games between the non-contenders and contenders, will have a significant impact, making them high-stakes games, which leads to increased viewership.  We will be left with relatively few low-stakes games, typically between the non-contenders and favorites, which likely do not play a major effect on tournament results, but we move from a group stage where the majority of games are low-stakes, to a majority of games that are high-stakes.\n",

This is supported by worlds viewership, which tends to be higher among games of CN vs KR, CN vs. EU, KR vs. EU.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The tournament would also be more competitively exciting as more teams would be considered contenders for the title, and it wouldn't come down to an eventual KR vs CN final (unless EU upsets).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, these changes are positive in terms of major region leagues, primarily NA and EU, as it gives greater incentive to the middle of the back and bottom teams to improve rosters as there is a chance for international competition even when placing 2nd regionally.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Minor Regions in this Format:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The clear downfall of this format is that few to no minor regions are represented.  In my opinion, this is okay, as the current format doesn't really offer much for the minor region teams.  They occasionally upset the Pool 3 teams listed above, but typically show up to MSI, play almost no high-stakes games and then leave after the group stage.  While it may be exciting to send a team from the minor regions, getting destroyed in a 25-minute game vs T1 or RNG is not a very rewarding experience for the minor region team players or fans and this inclusivity isn’t really achieving what it sets out to be.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that viewership between teams like T1 and RNG vs minor teams is typically higher than minor region vs minor region, but this is partially due to the fact that many of the viewers are in fact coming from CN and KR (although I cannot substantiate this with data).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tournaments like EU masters have proved that it is possible to have a tournament featuring non-top region teams and have high-stakes matches as well as great viewership and it would be in better interest to have a tournament among the minor regions to try and emulate this.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Having a smaller region tournament each year, whether around MSI time period or as part of All Stars, would be a proper way to have the minor regions have high-stakes competitive games against each other, with the winner of the tournament being invited to next year’s MSI as the minor region representative and it will be a good gage of upcoming regions which could follow in the footsteps of regions like VCS and cement themselves apart from the rest of the smaller regions as they show their dominance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I know, most people will bring the international wildcard tournaments which used to preface MSI and had low viewership, but I would hope that regional pride would be enough for fans to support their region in a more competitive tournament in which the teams can play many more games on more even footings and create and renew minor region rivalries.  As a fan of lesser-known regions, I would find this much more interesting to watch than my team going to MSI, getting absolutely blasted, and leaving after a short time.  If this event was part of All-Stars, it might be a way to bring more international viewership from the major regions, and it would be cool if they had players/personalities from the major regions involved in casting (maybe tri-casts with casters) and analyst desk, player interviews and integrated them within the tournament.  This would be a cool way to further propel all-star players from major regions' personalities and popularity, as well as use their viewership/following to shine a light on the minor region tournament.  They could also have segments with analysts, like Tim Sevenhyusen or the LCS/LEC analysts focused on scouting players from minor regions.  Maybe this is a big ask, but it could be fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this format change would certainly increase the cost to riot (so I definitely cheated a bit, according to the stakes set forth by Mark and Jatt), as they would have to host/integrate another smaller minor region tournament, which likely has reduced viewership, but it would be offset by much greater MSI viewership and interest.  However, if the tradeoff to have a better, more competitive MSI isn’t worth the cost increase, then overall it is a pretty rough outlook for Riot’s commitment to international tournaments.

These mini-reworks are a perfect way to bring some of the older champions in league up to date with the rest of the competition. With how successful most of the recent updates were, I thought it could be interesting to talk about other possible champions that could benefit from a similar treatment.\n",

In there a lot of people mentioned how he feels a bit underwhelming to play in his current form and that he would probably deserve some bigger scale changes that help him catch up with the rest of the game again. That's why I wanted to take the opportunity and share some of the ideas I have thought about when it comes to potential changes for the tree.\n",

I’m also fully aware of the big durability update that is coming to league next patch. But I still decided to include the numbers the way they are currently listed on the league wiki, to keep it easier for comparison. That said, all numbers would obviously have to get adjusted accordingly to the upcoming durability changes.*\n",

      "**Summary:** Initial passive proc gives more health. Q mana cost lower early on. E sapling damage reduced. Maokai now gets bonus move speed and W range against opponents hit by saplings. R moves faster initially, but speed and cc-duration grow less over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation for the Changes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Passive base healing increased  \\[5-65 &gt;&gt; 8-80 (based on level) health\\]  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;Passive percentage healing increased \\[5-15% &gt;&gt; 6-18% (based on level) of Maokai's maximum health\\]  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;Sap Magic's healing is reduced to 80% effectiveness, if the ability was already casted once in the last 8 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passive changes are mostly targeted towards top lane Maokai. Currently he has an incredibly hard time surviving against a lot of matchups up there. Most bruisers and fighters (with runes like Conqueror or Lethal Tempo) easily beat him in extended 1v1s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maokai’s best bet is to look for short trade windows, where he can use a few abilities, proc his passive and then disengage. But even that playstyle has stopped working over the years, since most opponents can easily match or beat his sustain over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "One big problem I see with Maokai’s passive is that it basically has to be balanced around two different things. It has to be strong enough to give him a realistic chance of surviving 1v1s in lane (something he is really struggling with at the moment). But it also can't be too strong, because that could result in him becoming too “drain-tanky” in bigger teamfights (where he is already fine for the most part).\n",
      "\n",
      "Buffing the passive and then only making the initial passive proc heal for 100% effectiveness would be a great opportunity to give Maokai more value in these short trades in lane, without automatically making him too oppressive in extended teamfights. Since his sustain in longer fights would mostly stay the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Q mana cost changed  \\[60 mana at all ranks &gt;&gt; 48 / 52 / 56 / 60 / 64 mana\\]  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;W mana cost increased  \\[60 &gt;&gt; 70 mana at all ranks\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q mana cost changes are trying to fix another important issue for top lane Maokai. Unlike most of the popular top laners these days, he is still heavily restricted by mana early on. Maokai has a lot of bad matchups in lane, which means he already has a fairly hard time contesting for the minion wave. His Q is his main spell to trade, farm, push and stack up his passive. But the current mana cost of his lower-ranked Q is simply too high for this. Reducing the mana cost early on would give Maokai a bit more freedom to utilize his main tool in lane more often. To balance things out the mana cost would be slightly higher from level 9 onwards (Top Lane Maokai maxes Q first). And a part of the mana cost is also pushed into his W, so his full combo against champions would still cost about the same amount of mana as it does now.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;E base damage and percentage damage (for both regular and brush empowered saplings) decreased  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;Enemy champions hit by saplings are now additionally marked for 4 seconds.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;Maokai gains 10% bonus movement speed when moving towards marked enemy champions.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;W target range (radius that Maokai can cast W in) is increased against enemy champions that were previously marked by (E) Sapling Toss.  \\[525 base range &gt;&gt; 700 range\\]  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;Additionally deals 4% of target's maximum health against enemy champions that were previously marked by (E) Sapling Toss.\n",
      "\n",
      "The E+W changes only make sense when looking at them combined. They are trying to target two important areas at once. First they would shift some power out of Maokai’s saplings. Which would be a decent way of making his E-max sapling-into-bush-spam playstyle a bit less annoying to face for a lot of opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand the changes would also help Maokai himself with one of his main weaknesses. With his current kit he is rather bad in the one thing that tanks are supposed to be really good at: engaging. His slow Ultimate is too unreliable of a tool to start fights with, which makes him very dependent on his W.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, his W is definitely a super strong ability. It's a point-and-click cc that also makes Maokai untargetable for a short frame. But it also pays a reasonably high price for this by having rather low range in return. This often makes Maokai very dependent on having Flash up to find engage opportunities. Without it he has a fairly hard time reaching opponents before he gets cc-ed or kited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of the new E+W combo is to give Maokai the same treatment that Xin Zhao got with his rework in the past. He would basically have a long-ranged ability that opponents have a fair chance of dodging or avoiding. But if the ability hits, Maokai gets additional range on his shorter-ranged point-and-click engage spell. This would give Maokai a more reliable engage tool, while still leaving his opponents enough room for counterplay.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe this combination of changes would push Maokai into a much healthier direction, especially when considering his current poke playstyle in the support position. He would probably still be a viable support that is great at controlling certain areas of the map with his saplings. But it would be less because of his uninteractive long-ranged poke and more because of the increased engage threat he offers when opponents walk near his controlled area.\n",
      "\n",
      "The E+W changes would also fix another smaller issue. At the moment it feels extremely one-dimensional how Maokai can use his E. Throwing it anywhere outside of bushes might be borderline-trolling, since the damage is terrible and it's super easy to avoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes would open up a lot more possibilities of how Maokai could utilize his E outside of bushes. For example to set up ganks for his jungler. Maokai could throw a sapling behind his lane opponent and basically force that opponent into taking a suboptimal escape route. Otherwise they would have to tank the sapling and give Maokai a better chance of catching up.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Q damage against monsters increased to 120%\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q damage buff against monsters is mainly to compensate for the sapling nerfs. Maokai's AoE damage to camps would suffer a bit from those adjustments and the small Q buff is supposed to make up for that. On top of that Jungle Maokai would also benefit from the passive changes, and the new E+W combo could make his ganks a bit more dangerous. To be honest, I don't believe the update would be enough to make Maokai a fully viable jungler again, but it might be just enough to at least give him the chance of becoming a rare niche pick.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",

      "&gt;R root duration decreased  \\[0.8-2.6 &gt;&gt; 0.8-2.0 (based on distance traveled) seconds\\]  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;R travel speed changed  \\[50-600 &gt;&gt; 80-500 units per second, accelerating over traveled time\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "These changes are basically supposed to make Maokai’s R slightly weaker but more reliable. At the moment a lot of the abilities' power-budget is wasted on the long root-duration and high speed it gets after having traveled for a long distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But hitting such a long-ranged R is pretty unrealistic in most cases. It can definitely be useful in situations where Maokai is flanking, but that is unlikely to happen considering that Maokai is often going to be the main frontliner on his team. Ideally he wants to be positioned between his own team and the enemy one when fights are breaking out. Adjusting Maokai’s R to move slightly faster initially would give him a bit more engage threat in these conventional front-to-back teamfight scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maokai’s R is already a great zoning tool for objectives. But it still feels a bit lackluster, when most opponents can just outrun it pretty easily. What this leads to in most situations is that Maokai will only use his R when he’s already on top of opponents for the instant root. It's basically only used as a cc-extension after his W. Which is quite sad and can’t really be the way his Ultimate is intended to be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't believe Maokai would need a completely different Ultimate to function properly. His old damage-reduction Ult (especially the second iteration that followed him around) was definitely stronger, but it also made him extremely stat-checky and unfun to play against. His current Ultimate seems a lot more creative and thematically fitting. I honestly believe the slow travel speed is all that would have to be changed in order to make it feel more rewarding again. Opponents would probably still have a fairly easy time getting away from it in most cases. But the change would still give Maokai a few more options on how he wants to use his Ult in different situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I can definitely understand people that would like to see bigger changes to Maokai, like completely reworking parts of his current ability set. The problem is that these bigger changes would obviously require a lot of work on Riot’s end that I’m not sure they are willing to invest in the near future. My approach here would probably still be enough to fix most of Maokai’s current issues without even requiring a lot of resources to do so. Most of the changes would be simple stat adjustments. And the only slightly difficult parts would be adding a new visual mark for his E and the conditionally increased range on his W. But even those additions should be fairly easy to implement.\n",

I choose jungle as a secondary role because I know I won't get it, so that leaves me securing top lane. Now why Tahm Kench you ask yourself, well you would be right that is a question. I play him because he big and he lick, I’ve played top lane before his rework and I continued to make it work.

If you can have that you will be in the clear. I remember an old adage that there was some percentage of your games you are meant to lose, just don't do that, it's very simple and helped me. Secondly always create a team comp that lend to your strengths, you already know your mid is going to be Yasuo, and your jungle will be Yi and your adc will be Ezreal, so just play tank and never die its very simple.

If you can live with those truths you will have much more peace of mind and will be able to concentrate on missing cannon. Also vision is good, I know because I am horrible at it.

      "I would personally like to have a small discussion about the current system refered to as \"smurf queue\", mostly because a \"smurf-queue bad pls fix\" post won't get us anywhere.   \n",

      "**For those who don't know:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time ago, when player complains about smurfs ruining their ranked experience reached an all time high. Riot implemented a band aid solution which puts players with a low amount of ranked games in recent time into games where everyone has a low number of ranked games played. This was called \"smurf queue\" as most of these games contain accounts of lv 35 and under. This system kind of successfully isolated the active ranked playerbase from the smurfs. This however created another problem. Those games will also include new players and players who have barely played ranked but are now trying to return to the grind. And smurf queue games, let me tell you, are extremely toxic. Skill desparity aside, some people don't smurf because they want to learn a new role, they do so because their last account got banned and sure as hell they will still throw a tantrum whenever one thing goes wrong. Flame, Soft inting, Ragequits. Every horror story you have heard about a league game is 10 times more likely to happen here than anywhere else. One of the biggest issues is that currently, you can easily buy a lv 30 account for basically pocket change, so toxic players do not care if their new account gets punished. 1 transaction later they are back on the rift  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say. Smurf queue should always be seen as a band-aid solution so today I would like to discuss some possible solutions as everything I came up with either does not work or is strictly wishful thinking  \n",

      "**some things to keep in mind when coming up with solutions:**  \n",
      "\\- smurfs themselves are pretty much inevitable  \n",
      "\\- the solution should benefit returning players and first time ranked players as they are put into this toxic mess  \n",

      "\\-&gt; this is just ok but where do you put the line? It might lead to botters leveling their accounts to just above that threshhold. It also kind of messes with newer players. League takes a lot of time to learn so even I wouldn't recommend ranked at lv 30 but the idea of waiting even longer than reaching 30 just so you can play a more fun ranked mode in a video game seems ridiculous  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Make it so a high lv player that has played ranked in past seasons is not put into smurf queue**  \n",
      "\\-&gt; yes, that works, but it only works for returning players. Everyone who tries ranked for the first time is still kind of screwed. I also believe we had an article or post talking about returning players into smurf queue problem and how they want to attack that but i don't think we have heard about that ever since  \n",

      "\\-&gt; the problem with botting is mainly that botters will figure out how to avoid bot detection and whenever bot detection is improved and those accounts get banned, they will just figure out how to avoid the newer system. I have very little tech-knowledge, so don't take what i say for granted. It's quite easy to spot a botted account as a human, but detection through a system is quite problematic.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Just fix the report system and hire more Humans for manual review**  \n",
      "\\-&gt; Part of the problem is that there are a lot of games and players to review, so like it or not, we have to rely on the report system to filter cases for humans to review. Unfortunately, the threshhold of how many reports are needed to ensue punishment is quite high. Why is that? because the report system is used by everyone. What i mean by that is you can click that report button for whatever reason you want and there are a ton of reports for things that are not banworthy. Raise your hand if a player in your last 3 games wanted to report the most underperforming (not inting!) player on his team. For the hiring part: I think we are lacking information on how exactly all of this works to estimate if that even helps  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

Also, a lot of the extremely toxic cases wont even care if they are banned after 8 games or after 4, just \"go next\". Again, i have no clue how the manual reviews even work and if hiring people even does something  \n",
      "**5.5 How about doing it without humans and let the ban system trigger quicker?**  \n",
      "\\-&gt; that doesn't really change a lot. Toxic people will have a lighter wallet yes, some might even get discouraged. the main problem with no humand review in this case is: remember what i said about reporting, how a tilted player will report an underperforming teammate, perhaps a player who just played his first few ranked games and got heavily outclassed because of course? yea that does not work. If you want to tighten to report system, it needs more humans IMO  \n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Just give them the Tyler 1 treatment. Ban all accounts belonging to repeat offenders**\n",
      "\\-&gt; Again, not a tech expert, but i don't think IP bans are possible with how data protection and VPN networks function nowadays. I am very open to be educated if I am wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TLDR/Conclusion:**  \n",
      "It's just hard to implement changes, you might be able to filter out the returning player, but 1st time ranked players aren't really distinguishable from smurfs and until the system releases them from smurf queue hell, they will likely have quit already. Turning off chat helps but Soft inting is still and issue and will be until the end of time  \n",

      "LoL Champion Idea: Blind Billygoat BillyThe character would be in short, a Blind Anthropomorphic Billygoat who bears a magical military fork. He uses such staff like military fork (2 pronged military fork) and his horns for combat in addition to navigation purposes, similar to a tuning fork. Lore wise, he would likely be an appropriate fit for a place like Freljord due to him being a Goat with hoofs built for such terrain. Billy as a Champion with his kit heavily relies on vision, some crowd control, and a bit of healing, making him a great tanky support or jungler. The support relying heavily on AP, healing his ally ADC and granting the ADC vision while his jungle role could be regarded similar to that of a Jax or a Yi, building AD in addition to using attack speed to activate a certain passive I have mentioned tied to his Q ability (he would have similar versatility to Warwick, Akali, Teemo and Shaco regarding AP and AD, choosing whichever fits the role he's playing).\n",
      "\n",
      "Abilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Passive: due to Billy relying heavily on his ears, enemies within areas of no visibility that move near him are picked up similar to a slightly larger oracle lense. The catch is that this vision is only applicable to Billy himself so his allies won't see if there is someone near Billy's Radius. This passive will also only work with Billy if the enemy Champion is moving. An example of the ability at play would be a cloaked teemo standing still in a bush vs. A cloaked teemo running around in a bush. The Teemo standing still will not be detected by the passive however, the teemo running around in the bush will be detected. Similar can be said for traps that stand still so Teemo's Mushroom Mines, Caitlyn's and Nidalee's Bear Traps in a Bush, Jhin's Blossoming Lotus Traps and Shaco's Jack in the Boxes won't be picked up. The only trap that will be picked up would be Maokai's explosive seedling minions due to them moving towards their target.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Billy does a jump dash similar to Kindred to his opponents. If the opponent is in the way of his jump dash, he lands a stun, similar to a Pantheon stun (the catch is that Billy's stun is like a skillshot rather than a Pantheon or Jax pouncing onto their enemies). This ability can be used to hop walls as well, similar to how Kindred is able to so such with her jump dash. \n",
      "(Optional) Q Passive: Billy bleeds the opponent after landing 5 consistent hits on the opponent. For each hit, a line is displayed on the enemy Champion's feet, each hit eventually forming a pentacle which then commences the bleeding effect. The bleeding effect would be true damage, similar to Darius's ability; however, unlike Darius where he stacks the bleeding effect, Billy will only have it active it once, making the bleeding effect act similar to a burn or a poison that uses true damage (this ability could potentially be paired with a Jungler running Press the Attack Runes for more effective damage). I labeled this passive as being optional because some could argue that this passive might be overkill within Billy's moveset (one heavily reliant on vision and crowd control). I added this passive for 2 reasons, 1st reason being to secure ganks after landing a stun (if he built jungle) and the 2nd reason was for physical one to one solo combat against champions like Mordekaiser, Sion, Warwick, Thresh, Nautilus, Blitzcrank or Galio\n",
      "\n",
      "W: Billy Taps his staff on the ground, giving an auditory queue in the form of a whistle, giving allies temporary true vision of his surrounding radius. This Radius would be similar to that of Quinn's heightened senses (if not a slightly larger Radius).\n",
      "\n",
      "E: Billy starts to hum a musical tune which resonates with his military fork. Billy channels a healing spell, standing in his place, similar to a Master Yi, yet healing allies that surround him as well similar to a Sona or Seraphine's healing ability. This healing ability leaves Billy vulnerable which can easily be used against him by projectile lock champions like Neeko, Lux, Senna, Nami, Brand, Xerath, Morgana, Zyra, etc. Even hook Champion's like Pyke, Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus and regarding enemies in other lanes with similar abilities, Amumu and Sylas. This is a key point because his moveset with abilities like granting vision to allies can be easily regarded as fairly overpowered so having flaws to counter him might be appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "R: Similar to Sion's ult and a Nunu Snowball, Billy Charges towards his enemy, the catch is that the enemy is knocked back in a similar manner to Alistar's charge, doing varied damage similar to a nunu snowball (but the ult isn't heavily reliant on damage, rather the stun brought from it). If the person hits a wall, they will be stunned with varied time similar to that of a Nunu snowball. Billy will also have temporary vision of his opponent when the charge has been successfully landed so even if Billy knocks the opponent back a fair distance after landing his ult, he will still have temporary vision of their whereabouts for a few seconds before they vanish. Optionally, while Billy is charging, this could also act like many staff taps going off at once, giving his allies vision of his surrounding area while charging (similar to Senna's cannon when she ults, giving a trail of vision after its been activated).\n",
      "\n",
      "This might seem fairly overpowered as a move kit though due to his movement being a mix of Melee (like his jump dash and his ultimate) and Enchanter (like his healing song and his vision granting abilities), Billy becomes an extremely vulnerable target to anti tanks builds like Vayne even if he's granted vision of her chasing him down via passive (Billy might be able to land a stun or use the same ability to get away but Vayne will easily be able to hunt him down due to such jump dash being a moderate distance). Other major weaknesses to Billy would be projectile stuns like those found on Lux, Morgana, Neeko and Jhin (to an extent). Another counter to Billy would be Traps/land minds like Teemo's Mushrooms, Shaco's Jack in the Box and Jhin's Blossoming Lotus Traps. Finally, Dive champions like Gwen, Fiora, Camille and Irelia would also counter Billy due to Billy being a Tank in addition to their armor penatration and high attack speeds. Master Yi and Jax would also be counters if they build runes like Press the Attack due to their attack speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Curious what yall think about this idea regarding Billy the Blind Billygoat. Do you think there should be a support and or jungler built around a mix of crowd control and vision granting abilities or does that seem fairly overpowered, especially when Billy's moves set could lead to him being a pain to gank as enemy junglers if not hell if they attempt to invade or Ambush Billy. Yeah, it might be slightly ironic that Billy is a Blind Billygoat champion granting others vision though it plays off of the idea of losing a vital sense like vision and having your other senses like the auditory sense, develop and become stronger, using the sounds surrounding you to navigate in an echolocation manner. Alternatively, Billy's character design could also be fitting for an Anthropomorphic Bat (perhaps a Bat Demon from Noxus. Would be fitting, especially regarding the Q Passive with the bleed) or even a Minotaur to an extent due to the 2 horns. Either way, Billy would be a pretty fun Champion to play as either Support or Jungle.\n",

I ended my run in grandmaster at around 70% win rate overall before quitting ranked. I say this not to brag but to give credibility to my understanding of what made Olaf one of the best top laners in the game. (Better than his jungle)\n",

      "\\- Early game kill potential. By running ghost and going all-in with Q you could get first blood about 90% of your games at lvl 1-2.   \n",
      "**After update - Q cooldown is much longer, base damage lower, as well as a longer minimum cast range. This combined with the cooldown only being allowed to reset to 3 seconds significantly hurts his all in potential. The passive change also obviously hurt his early game dueling potential against bruisers that would commit back to you. from 100% max AS Lvl1 to 40% max.**\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- W sustain. If you managed to get a kill lvl 1 and survive with low HP you had the option of taking W lvl 2 and life-stealing most if not all of your health back in 1 to 2 W's. Or you could all in your laner when they TP back to the minions while you're below 50% HP getting a 2nd kill at lvl 2.  \n",
      "**After update - You can no longer do this, his overall sustain seems cut about 60-90%. The old W mechanic where all healing was increase the lower you got made Olaf feel like a Berzerker he doesn't feel like this anymore early/mid with the AS changes and healing changes, they aren't nearly as impactful. W shield is a joke early/mid unless you are near 30% hp.W now has a auto reset built in. This mechanic is somewhat useless because you would always follow your auto up with an E to reset/Make use of his auto CD.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Attack speed/Tower killing. - As you got your early lane advantage and kept killing your laner you had easy access to their Tower plates. You would intentionally keep your hp low to get a bunch of Bonus AS for taking plates. This combined with your W attack speed and 6 second duration meant you could secure many early plates or a whole tower.  \n",
      "**After update - Passive gives less attack speed/ W duration cut from 6 sec to 4 sec as well as less attack speed. These changes make it significantly harder to take tower plates and snowball. Not only due to the reduced attack speed but also from the reduced ability to kill your laner.**\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Duels top lane LVL 6 and on. Due to his 6 second ult duration and 6 second W duration you could easily duel just about any melee top laner since they had to commit at a close range for around that duration before one of you would die.  \n",
      "**After update - W duration reduction/Ult duration reduction. The ult being reduced from 6 to 3 is a massive hit to this aspect of his laning. 1v1's/1v2's would rarely last much longer than the 6-second Ult/W duration. Yes you can refresh the duration with Auto's or E now but it isn't as strong as you'd think. The duration can only be extended by another 2.5 (This effect doesn't stack) It only refreshes. You would normally use your E right after an auto when engaging the fight. At this point you only have your auto's to refresh your ULT duration. If the enemy flashes or gains any distance from you your ult will now be useless. You can no longer use the ult Bonus move speed to run at them, by the time you get to them after their dash/movement your ult will now be gone. You have to wait till you are on top of them to ult which means you are open to being cc'd. Another overall nerf to his kill potential in lane.**\n",

      "Mid late / Late game - Olaf is pretty well known for falling off extremely hard, win rates showcased this as plummeting after a certain point in-game. Put simply some of Olafs power has been taken from early snowball potential and put into his MidLate/Late post-lane potential. Although it seems like this might only be the case vs certain comps that can't kite him. If the enemy team can wait out his 3-second ult duration then he is rendered useless and in a 200 YEAR gameplay meta champions should easily do this. He has always operated as a team fight disruptor diving damage soaker or as a Peeling tank shredder.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I'd say he can do these jobs better because your ULT MR/ARMOR stay up even when activated. This allows you to get away with dropping a tank item for a damage HP item instead of an HP/RESIST item. Allowing you to dive the backline with more Damage and same tankiness in theory (Although overall ability to drain tank has been significantly reduced). I used to be able to heal from 10-30% to full in 1-2 seconds with VISAGE/Ravenous and W, No longer as easy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Your Q armor shred WOULD be the best part of this buff except for the fact that it seems like nobody plays tanks (I haven't been around much lately so idk). as a late-game disruptor you would try to land Q on as many of the enemy team as possible if you engage - Pop randuins on entire team - Pick up axe again... throwback towards your team through them... rinse repeat. Armor Shred on Q makes this aspect much more potent. So against the tankier teams specifically this is a insane buff which pushes his identity as this type of teamfighter which is very unique and I have always loved about Olaf.\n",

Suddenly turning the tides with rage when all seems lost. Now his passive is just some permanent lifesteal and lower AS. Leaving Olaf more like a fighter and less like a Berzerker.

      "Heimerdinger needs a rework.The reasoning for this is simple, in my opinion, but I see almost nobody talk about this champion - likely because of his playrate - but I really do feel like this does need to be touched on. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no champion in the game as uninteractive as Heimerdinger. Almost every champion in the entirety of League, as salt-inducing as some may be, can be played around. With Yasuo, you poke their shield out and dodge the tornado. With Tryndamere, you try to stop him from building fury, or even with Master Yi you can CC him or try to burst him out. When you play against Heimerdinger, the obvious course of action is to destroy his turrets, but they're deceptively tanky and you'll usually get shot once or twice while doing so. Then, when it's destroyed, the cooldown is relatively low and it will just get replaced. This leads to an uninteractive play pattern of permanent pushing, regardless of your lane opponent. It is antifun on both sides of the lane. The Heimer player does very little, aside from replace turrets and take a few potshots with W or E, whereas their opponent just accepts their fate to farm under tower until their team comes to intervene. This is why Banner of Command and ZZ'Rot Portal were removed, yet there is a champion centered entirely around that style of play. \n",
      "\n",

      "In comparison to other mid and top laners, there is so little going on. Against a Fiora, you make sure to keep your vitals safe while trying to whittle her down and bait the parry. Against Darius, you have to make sure you don't get hooked or hit by the outer edges of Q, keep your bleed down and look for favorable trades when he uses those cooldowns as you kite them out. Against Yasuo, you have to dodge the tornado and pop the shield with autoattacks, alongside baiting the windwall and ensuring that you don't get dashed on with your positioning. When playing into a Heimer, however, you effectively resign all proactive authority you can have on your own and just farm instead of playing an enjoyable game of League of Legends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's due to this uninteractivity in lane that I would propose Heimerdinger needs a rework, because a champion like him does not belong in modern League of Legends. In modern league, the ability to interact with your opponent is where the vast majority of the gameplay comes from. Let's use the Urgot rework for example - he went from a champion that point and clicks a bunch after one skillshot that nobody played into something where you need to position yourself carefully to use your shotgun knees, which on it's own changes the game drastically. Take into account the W toggle and the rest of his kit and you have a champion that interacts a lot at all points of the game, feels relatively nice to play as and doesn't feel blatantly awful to play against on a base level. A rework like this would drastically help Heimer - it would very likely make him much more fun to play as and against, which in turn would shoot his playrate up and potentially encourage people to try him out instead of seeing a champion where something you place does 75% of the work for you and you don't really do much. I know I wouldn't be against the idea of playing a big brained mad scientist who's inventions do most of the work, but in his current state I have no desire to play as or against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "To throw a potential idea out into the open, maybe Heimer could have a Charge meter on his turrets, in which their damage or attack speed is affected by how long they've been on the field, and this could be replenished over time by champion combat. That would ensure that Heimer at least has to try to fight in lane and do something that enables you to consciously make a trade instead of feeling resigned to the jungler's whims - it forces him to play aggressive to keep his push going, which in turn enables you to make a trade outside of the range of his turrets once in a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, it's certainly not the best idea. I thought of it on the spot while I was writing this, but I do understand that Heimerdinger players likely enjoy their turrets. To keep that aspect of him, though, something needs to be done to make sure that the Heimer player has to be active in lane. Forcing him to fight to keep his turrets at full potential (maybe with a higher ceiling than now, as I don't wanna straight up nerf a champion that already sees very little play) would ensure that you can occasionally fight him once your wave builds up instead of it being pushed into tower forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, Heimer isn't overpowered - but with the Udyr rework coming up, I'm almost 100% certain that Heimerdinger is the champion that least fits the game - he's uninteractive to play as and against due to the turrets, and goes against what seems to be Riot's design philosophy going forward - lately, it's been more and more action, frequent roaming is encouraged and a fast pace is also pushed. Heimerdinger removes the ability to play a game with any of these things without being severely punished until laning phase is over. Turrets and an AoE stun discourage proactive gameplay, roaming leaves you with half a turret the second you leave, and the game is reduced to a snail's pace as the only thing you can really end up doing is occasionally clearing a turret and farming minions under your tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry for repeating points a bit too much - I wrote this at 352AM, so it might be a little more incoherent than I hoped, but the point remains - Heimerdinger does not fit in modern League of Legends, and I really hope he's slated for a rework soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: Heimerdinger does not fit in current League due to his turrets encouraging a constantly pushing playstyle with little interaction - the exact reason why Riot removed Banner of Command and ZZ'Rot Portal, and as such should be reworked to encourage proactive gameplay during laning.\n",
      "Heimerdinger Needs a Rework.I'm gonna be honest, this post is partially fueled by salt, but I feel like it needs to be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why the FUCK is Heimer allowed to exist in the state he's in? I don't even care about his strength level. He genuinely should just be straight up disabled until Riot reworks him. Even old-ass champs like Udyr allow you to even try to play or some shit, or laning against a midlaner like Yasuo or Yone or something like that, you can dodge the Q, run away and attempt to survive. They don't kill you by just passively existing. Heimerdinger needs a rework before anything else happens, because while every other champion is in some way, shape or form interactive, Heimer can just remove the interactivity from the game altogether. Against a Yasuo, i'm constantly poking, removing the shield, trying to ensure that I don't get hit by the tornado, etc. Against a Xerath, you have to constantly dodge, but if you can close that gap and his E is down, you get your turn. \n",
      "\n",
      "Heimer doesn't let that happen. He sets down his turrets, automatically pushes faster than almost every laner you can play, and turns his brain off, ironically. The fact that he has actual abilities on top of it rubs insult into injury, because I see Heimer players just brainlessly throw them in my general direction while I'm left to cope under my tower, trying to cs while being pelted by turret fire while Heimer stands borderline still as he has the game played for him. You're supposed to interact with the turrets by killing them, but by doing so you just eat 3 shots from them while you do so and come out behind in health, and he'll just place another and resume standing there. It's so fucking boring, even if you can just farm and outscale. As the Heimer player, I can't see how it'd be fun to just place turrets and permanently and automatically push and against Heimer it's not fun whatsoever to just accept that you're going to have to farm under tower unless your jungler is going to gank you and hopefully manage to kill him before the turrets shoot him to death. Lane bullies are fine, but a character that literally just stands there as auxiliary turrets shoot you to death and give him the credit is fucking stupid. Playing into Darius, it's a careful spacing game, where you have to not let his E land and to avoid his attempts to run you down. Against a Viktor? Dodge the E to the best of your ability, don't let him get quick Q trades off, etc. Against Zoe? Dodge star and bubble, stand behind minions, punish when she overextends. Against Heimer? Sit there. Try to kill his turrets as he keeps replacing them while you're slowly pushed to your tower as nothing else happens. The game is reduced to farming under your tower and waiting for your team to make any plays. It is not interactive on either side. As the Heimer, you're barely playing proactively - you might ward here or there, but for the most part, you just let your turrets do everything and maybe land the occasional skillshot. Doesn't really make a difference, unless it's RW which is almost never used and you just save for RQ instead. Laning against him? You can't fight him while his turrets are there, so you just keep destroying them as he replaces them and they just shoot your wave down and occasionally poke at you until you go absolutely fucking insane waiting for something to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "After remembering what it's like to play against a Heimer, win or lose, he's just going on the permaban list. I might lose to shit like Yone missing every q and killing me with double crit, but I at least know that I could have not overextended, or dodged the ult, or SOMETHING. With Heimer, it just sucks any fun out of the game. Today was the only time I have ever yelled at a video game, even while winning, and I really can't justify why Riot hasn't done anything to rework him. For all they speak about interactive champions and reworking dated kits, Heimerdinger is an outlier, with nothing slated as far as I can tell and by far the least engaging gameplay experience on both ends in the entire game, to the point where you can play him with one hand and not really care too much. It's absurd how this champion hasn't been reworked in all of their years of existence when it actively encourages uninteractivity and permanent pushing. Isn't this kind of shit why ZZ'Rot and Banner of Command were removed, too?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry about typing so much here, but after that experience I just had to make this post and sort of vent and ask why Heimer players actually enjoy the champion. It feels like the only reason you would play them is because you're a sadist and you wanna watch a TV show in the background or do your taxes or some shit while also playing league. Even Yuumi has to look out for being knocked off of their champion, aim Q's, use their passive shield, all that stuff, but Heimer just drops turrets and pushes for existing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can anybody actually give me a good reason Heimerdinger does not need at least a mini-rework to make playing as and against him slightly more interactive?\n",

      "Hardstuck B3-4 looking for advice.Hi, Istarted playing S5 and was always Silver at the verge of Gold. Never could beat my promos but now I'm hard stuck at bronze for multiple seasons even though I have improved quite a few things. \n",
      "\n",
      "I started playing as adc this season after beeing placed in a lower Iron division can't remember if it was 3 or 4. And there the nightmare began. I focus quite a bit on CS instead of always fighting. I'm able to hit 7-9 cs/min on a regular basis (Still not 100% consitstant but its something i still work on). \n",
      "\n",
      "My supps didn't like that and loved to pick fights we shouldn't pick and I started to ignoring them because I knew that those won't take us anywhere. Well it ended almost everytime in them raging flaming and trolling. \n",
      "\n",
      "Result = sub 40% winrate bot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thats why i tried going mid and top. I ended up beeing at top and try to play pretty much the same way. keep it safe outfarm lane oponent don't pick stupid fights (e.g 1v5, 2v5, playing aram or even a 1v1 while beeing behind) and split push when enough enemies are visible and drake and baron are not up, focus onjectives etc. . Still get flamed for it but who cares (I watched a lot of guides and coaching and I'm pretty sure this is often the right call). But even outfarming them by 100-200% regularly I still have a 43% winrate overall. I managed to get it to 50% spaming Shen and GP top over the last 2 weeks for the last 20-40 games or so.  But i still lose LP I droped 1,5 divisions back to B4 in the last week alone with a 50% winrate. I generally lose more LP than I gain for a win. Stating to [OP.gg](https://OP.gg) I'm ace / mvp in about 40-50% of my games only loosing my lane very rarely when for example getting counterpicked by a teemo who knows that he can bully a Shen (Its rare but it happenes). My goal is always to at least go even on bad matchups.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know this doesn't happen in all games but in a majority of them it looks like my team activly tries to throw the game as much as possible. I regulary have games where mid and bot die 15+ times in under 10 min while I'm like 2/0/0 or 0/0/0 in top.  Its still managable to win some of them if the team starts to listen to danger pings baron calls instead of aram etc. I'm by no means a perfect player but I feel like I just don't belong there (I know we all heared it a 1000 times) I just see players all the time going for insenly stupid fights just mashing their heads together and hoping that it works somehow. Its like they expect their enemy doesn't use their abilitys or has none at all and just lets them kill them while completly ignoring farming. Íts just so damn frustrating that those obvious things just get ignored.  And they often don't even realize that we only won because I had a big enough gold lead to stall out the game long enough so we could win. Just had a  13/4/18 Shen game where I was top kd/a, kills, gold, cs, structure dmg and champion dmg (Yes top dmg Shen not going a weird dmg build) and my team flamed me for not joining fights all the time or not ulting the jungler who decided it was a good idea to solo stay in their base after we just barely won a teamfight and managed to get mid inhib as a 5/9/xx  kayne (Baron was up and pretty much free) . Even pinging him couldn't change his mind and I got flamed for not ulting (Because ulting into a 5v2 instead of finishing baron is the better play duh). We won but 3 of my m8s had litterly 0 clue what was going on the whole time. It was more like we won last fight oh there is an adc in the enemy jungle. Uhh where team? Why screen grey?\n",
      "\n",
      "This elo also seems to have serious smurfing problem. The gaps are often insane. 200+ cs 30+/0/xx at 20 min is something i got pretty used to seeing (Even though most of accuesed players are either not smurfs or their main is definatly not high elo but i have teammates and enemies which are on a 10 game winstreak with those stats quite often but somehow more often as an enemy). \n",

      "Imagine you’ve just loaded into the last game of your Platinum promotional series and your team decides to group together, just in case the enemy invades.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ve read them like a book. They head into your jungle to meet their demise. You clean ace them, with your Top laner securing a Penta Kill. He returns to base with 1600 Gold to spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question is, if you could choose which Champion your Top laner was playing — who would it be? Ignore their current win rates. Take a second and actually think about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why that Champion over any other? Does it really make a difference, isn’t 1600 Gold going to be just as effective on anyone?\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Gold Multiplier\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we’re talking about a metric that I call “The Gold Multiplier”, but from my example above you may prefer the term *“Snowballatility”* (or not, depending on how much you like to abuse the English language).\n",
      "\n",
      "The simple explanation is: how does Gold impact a Champions win rate?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mathematically, we calculate it like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Find the 66th percentile of Gold @ 10 minutes. In other words, which value would mean that 66% of games are below it and 33% are above it.\n",
      "* Flag all the games where a Champion is in this top 33% of Gold @ 10 (i.e. all the games where the Champion is notably ahead).\n",
      "* Compare the Win Rate of these games vs. the Champions average game.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if a Champion had a 50% win rate but won 65% of their games when they were ahead at 10 minutes, their Gold Multiplier (*snowballatility*) is 1.30x (0.65/0.50).\n",

      "What surprised me when I first did this exercise was Renekton being the lowest. I thought he was a snowballing Champion? Get him ahead and win the game, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have to differentiate the **probability** of a Champion getting ahead from its **effect**. Let’s take an ADC example for this one. Imagine Draven and Twitch. Who is the most likely to snowball? Draven. Who would be more likely to carry a game with a level 1 penta? Twitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s the same for Renekton, he has all the tools to get ahead but that doesn’t mean he’s the best when he’s there.\n",
      "\n",
      "## To be “Economic”\n",
      "\n",
      "If you watch any amount of professional play, you’ve probably heard the term “eco(n)” before. It’s short for “economic” and it refers to how well a Champion or player performs with low resources. Or in other words, it’s the antithesis of snowballing. *Antisnowballatility*, if you like.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can calculate it in a similar way, except rather than looking at all the games where a player is in the top 33% of Gold @ 10, we look at the bottom 33%.\n",

      "Irelia and Riven? Their duelists. They go in, zip around, deal huge amounts of damage, flash their level 7 mastery and type “gg ez” in all chat. They offer nothing else. This playstyle doesn’t work so well if they’re considerably behind.\n",

Think about it… it’s basically a metric to say how strong a Champion is with more Items, since that’s where the Gold goes. So, don’t Champions that scale well also snowball well?\n",
      "\n",
      "To test this we first calculate a metric for “late game scaling” by taking all games in the top 33% of length and then comparing those win rates to the average. Again, in English: how many more games does the Champion win when the game goes late.\n",

A trail of dead nobles leads her to the northern hinterlands and she returns with trepidation back to her hometown of Uwendale. Bad omens are many; dead wyverns and rabid wolves to name a few but the most alarming is the amassing visitors pilgrimaging to Uwendale for the Slayer’s festival.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Quinn was silent and still, eyeing the blank-staring Kynon across the table like a hawk preying on a rodent. The man was cuffed, hands behind his back and arms bound to the chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door behind the ranger-knight creaked open and the sound of armor rustled as Mealla, the warden of Uwendale entered. She shook her head once, signaling to Quinn that they hadn’t found any clues for how Tabitha was set ablaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sinking feeling, like a sword underwater, cut through Quinn. No clues found could also be a clue. If there was nothing logical about it, then it’s simply pointing towards the supernatural or magical. The question was the motive at hand. She leaned over the table, taking a better look at the maskless Kynon. He looked much older than she’d expected. His hair and eyes matched the color of the room’s stony interior. Deep wrinkles lay folded over his gaunt face and the bright burn marks were a stark contrast to his pale skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kynon,” she said, “tell me again what happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man didn’t meet her gaze. His voice was neutral when he retold his version of the incident for the fourth time. “Young Nollaig had been sorting out the herbs too close to the hearth. Master Tabitha was too distraught to notice her surroundings and she accidentally stepped on the burning herbs. Before I knew it, she had turned into a pillar of flame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The same retelling, word for word. Even the cadence was the same monotone, but Quinn couldn’t decide whether it was due to shock or from practiced rehearsals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That doesn’t make sense,” Mealla said. “She would’ve needed to be dunked in a vat of oil for the fire to turn that big that fast, not from flammable herbs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s what happened,” Kynon replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quinn agreed with her mother. She had stepped away from the hearth room for a moment to grab the books, still hearing the wake-tenders cry for help. She had managed to fill the bag to the brim when the cries suddenly turned to shrieks. It had been half a minute at most. It must be magic, but why was the wake-tender the target? Wasn’t a ranger-knight a more enticing prey?\n",
      "\n",
      "She rubbed clammy palms over her sleeves, feeling comfort from the hidden daggers strapped to her underarms. It seemed that she wasn’t the only fidgeting person in the room, based on how the warden rested a hand on a crossbow by the belt.\n",
      "\n",
      "More guards would’ve helped, but they were outside and doing their best to calm the distressed villagers together with the mayor. Was that Kynon’s goal? But then, killing Quinn would’ve caused the same kind of distress, if not more.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Six months.”\n",

      "The gray man finally lifted his gaze, meeting Quinn’s. Her fingers twitched and she had to hold herself back from reaching a dagger.\n",
      "\n",

      "“The Eternal Hunters were peering over something among the rubbles and I realized that it was my wife. They asked her what she would choose, and I prayed that she would fight for her life, to run from death as best she could. But Leanna asked for the arrow so Lamb pulled her bow and claimed my wife’s soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I waited for them to turn to me. I prepared myself to choose Wolf, to resist death. I knew that I would fail and that Wolf’s jaw would crush my neck but it’s what I had learned to do from the tally-men. Kindred turned towards me. White Lamb and Black Wolf, wearing masks of each other. They stared at me for a long moment as if pondering. Then they left.”\n",

      "The warden of Uwendale set her jaw, as if bearing pain from an old injury.\n",

      "The ranger-knight bit her tongue and clasped her hands, suppressing the urge to throw a dagger between the man’s eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly, sound returned to the room. First from the scraping of Quinn’s chair against the stone floor as she rose. Then from her low voice saying with certainty, “You’re not from the Arbormark.”\n",

      "“I thought you would start with ‘I told you so’,” Mealla opened one of Tabitha’s books, her brow furrowed in concentration, then she shook her head in defeat, closing it. “I don’t even know where to start with these ciphers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can gloat when all this is over,” Quinn replied. She closed the ledger and headed for the window. The festival should’ve been bustling, but there was a worried tension in the air, clinging to the attendees and weighing their shoulders. The noon bell struck three times, she would be late for her meeting with Glendon the merchant, but more pressing things were at hand. Valor had also yet to return from his scouting of Jax.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Imprisonment or exile.” There was an edge in Mealla’s voice. “Those are the only options for those afflicted with magic. Have you heard of the elixirs they force down on mage suspects?”\n",

      "“It’s for the greater good of Demacia.” Just saying it tasted sour inside Quinn’s mouth, but she held fast and grabbed an empty parchment from a stack and began to write. “Trust the High Council. Trust that they know what’s best for our nation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do they know what’s best for Uwendale?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you?” Quinn snapped back. “Because there’s a lot of things pointing towards you, Warden. The lack of rangers, the Slayer’s festival, the lack of security and huge influx of visitors, and that’s not even mentioning the Noxian spy who has been snooping around for six months right under your watch. You claimed I lost my edge when we discussed the wyvern corpse. Isn’t it ironic?”\n",

She reached for her mother’s hand, squeezing it. “Tell me what you’re hiding. Everything’s pointing at treason, but I know you better than that. Why is Uwendale holding a strange festival during this chaos?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mealla looked down at Quinn’s trembling hands. “The Wings of Demacia,” she murmured. “It’s a great title. Fit for you and Valor. Reaching anywhere the High Council asks you to go, even behind enemy lines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quinn’s eyes widened. She backed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t think I noticed your slight limp?” Mealla continued. “How you pull down your sleeves? Injuries are normal for a ranger, maybe expected even, but they’ve run you ragged, Quinn. And how do they thank you? By giving you another mission, keeping you too busy to think for yourself.”\n",

      "“Why should I say anything when you refuse?” Mealla said. “Because you’re my superior and ordering me?” She took a step closer. “Because you’re my daughter and want me to listen to your plea?” Mealla stared straight at Quinn. “Because you’re a ranger who can’t trust their partner?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trust?” Quinn’s knuckles turned white from how hard she clenched. “Is that what this is? You think that I didn’t say anything about my missions because I didn’t trust you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The warden didn’t reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fine.” Quinn rolled up her sleeves, revealing the bruises and scars. “You want to see the cut on my head?” She pulled back her hair. “From an enemy archer. Would’ve sunk deeper into my skull if it wasn’t for my visor. And that one on my left leg, I got it in Trevale.” With each wound she exposed, Quinn grew bolder and fiercer with her words. “This one, in Frostheld. Almost cut to the bone. I thought I wouldn’t be able to move my arm anymore.” When she was finally done, it was as if she’d been dunked in ice water. Shocked, huffing and shivering, followed by a slow, rising heat.\n",

      "“Then let him in,” Quinn said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He doesn’t want to enter Uwendale, he’s afraid that it might cause more problems. He’s waiting by the forest edge with some… well, some dead watchmen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It took a few moments and some repeats for Quinn to extract the information from the ranger-in-training. None of it had sounded real but Quinn believed every word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Send for the mageseekers,” she ordered Mealla, then exited the warden’s office before her mother had a chance to reply. She rushed back to Darragh’s workshop, finding Glendon the merchant outside and still waiting for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir, eh, Lady Knight,” he spluttered, “How may I, may I be of —”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Did you see any Illuminators leave the camp with anyone?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The merchant furrowed his brow. “Well, yes, but isn’t that quite normal? People ask for their assistance all the time, don’t they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, Glendon,” Quinn said, putting a coin in the man’s palm then walking past him. “Keep watch of them for me. I’ll return with more questions later.”\n",

      "On the alternative \"solutions\" of MSI**Summary**\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, we all know the controversy of MSI. In brief, because the LPL representatives RNG are locked down with no mobility, they cannot be present in Busan. As such, the current decision Riot has made is to have all participants play on a fixed ping. Disadvantages of this scheme are that it is 1) hard to balance and control for the asymmetry between the environment in Shanghai and Busan 2) Pro players historically practice for stage games on low ping for the most part 3) The meta may be significantly different on low ping vs 30ms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Involved Parties**\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The players: I'm sure every player, including those on RNG, wish the entire tournament was played on LAN. The numerous complaints by them on this current fiasco is evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Riot: They want this event to go on and ideally break even.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) LPL: From what I've heard (sources questionable), they are relatively indifferent about the event, if not leaning towards not attending in the first place. RNG in particular is under extreme lockdown, making it infeasible for attending personally.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential \"Solutions\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "1) **The LPL doesn't show up.** This is problematic as we significantly cut an overwhelmingly large fraction of the viewerbase. You cannot force these viewers to care enough to watch a tournament without any team to root for. This may be surprising for a lot of us in the West with very few teams that are world-class, and therefore we are more likely to look outside our own countries and root for foreign teams, but for Chinese fans, most of them will not watch a tournament without significant representation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Potential counterarguments:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **So? Why care about the loss of viewership? Competitive integrity is more important.** I don't have inside knowledge, but I'm pretty sure the tournament would be a financial disaster for Riot to host. If such a thing were to happen, who would foot the bill? Maybe they cut a lot of skins for unpopular champions they had planned? Maybe they cut Arcane 2? How much would need to be sacrificed to foot such a large bill?\n",
      "* **Ask Tencent to cover the bill?** Good luck on convincing a large company that makes an insignificant fraction of their revenue from League in investing the resources for an event with pretty much no returns for investment.\n",
      "* **Why not minimize the loss as much as possible?** We'd need to know the details of how much each thing costs on the balance sheet. How much would the event cost if there was no live audience and venue bookings, no hype videos, etc.? Would the teams be okay with significantly decreasing the prize pool? Would advertisers back out from a plain event? Some of these decisions made previously are likely irreversible. I'd be willing to bet that even if Riot cut every extraneous thing, the cost would still be too high for them to put up with.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) **Cancel MSI.** I think that despite what some people claim on Reddit, that a large silent majority would rather there be an event or nothing at all. Or at least, a large number of people who regardless on the opinion of whether MSI should continue or not would still watch the event with all its flaws. Even if they cancelled it now, there's probably already a large cost present to having started the event, which brings up the question of who foots the bill as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) **Have the LPL play on 30ms and everyone else plays on LAN.** I don't see any of the top LPL teams who would be willing to play at this disadvantage. Imagine getting humiliated by a clearly weaker team by getting \"outplayed\". Some of their fans would probably turn on them. The more reasonable fans would probably not watch a \"rigged\" tournament which brings up the same issues as mentioned previously. Fans of successful regions are ruthless. I don't know if anyone remembers when RNG lost to G2 back when they were the favorites, but the backlash was insane and if IG did not win the whole thing...\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential counterarguments:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Why not force the LPL team to play subjected to unequal ping?** The question is, how? I'd be willing to bet that the LPL is willing to give up its fourth worlds spot this year to not attend. If you put in higher punishments, you risk angering the entire viewerbase which not only affects this event, but subsequent ones. Also, what higher punishment can you incur? If LPL doesn't show up to MSI, they lose the privilege of attending worlds? Now worlds is an infeasible event. Subject the LPL to fines or make them foot the bill if they don't agree? Should this happen, the playerbase will protest, and arguably rightfully so. Is it fair to punish a region that supposedly voted overwhelmingly not to go in the first place and only decided to participate to make the event feasible? Also, the LPL is fully capable of standing by itself without ever attending international events. It's like the NBA. \n",
      "* **There's got to be a team willing to play in such conditions**. Yes there probably is, but I doubt it'd be one of the top ones. Imagine if any other region sent their bottom-of-the-pack or mediocre team. I honestly would still watch, but I could not say that about most of the viewerbase. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) **Have LPL play against every other team at 30ms, and every other game is on LAN.** I think this is clear from previous posts, but practicing for two different environments is probably infeasible for most of the teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) **Do 4) but make all LPL games exhibition matches that don't contribute to anything.** I personally think this is probably an ok alternative solution. However, I don't know how much this would affect viewership. Would fans care to watch if their team's wins and losses don't matter? I'm not sure. Also, how would knockouts work assuming the LPL team advances? \n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "All-in-all, I agree that there are large flaws with the current solution. However, I don't see how any of the other solutions are better enough to merit changing the format at such a late stage. I think the unfair portrayal of Riot being a greedy capitalist company is egregiously unfair: it was only recently after all that these international events broke even and became profitable. I do, however, agree in the need for the execution of the current solution to be a lot better.\n"
