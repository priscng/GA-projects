DotA2,"How are teams justifying picking Mars, when his winrate in tournaments is always below 45%","I completely get picking mars, he has everything except bkb piercing abilities, and some would argue that he lacks an instant reliable stun, but he fits and plays well in every line up, and usually has a good laning stage.
We have all seen and heard this before.

What i am wondering is, why is he valued more than most other offlaners, when his win rate is consistently low in tournaments and even high immortal games.
Doesnt his consistent low win rate reflect somehow, that the hero falls short in some aspect.

Is it team comfort, flex potentiale, player hero specialists, first pick potentiale or something else im missing, that make mars so desirable to pick?",1652852244

I honestly have no idea what could be causing this problem and I have tried looking around online but the solutions I found were either not relevant to what I was facing or summed up to ""your internet is crap"". 

These lag spikes absolutely do not show up when I play with bots and the game runs at a smooth 60fps with little to no variation.

DotA2,ESL One Stockholm 2022 Main Event Day 3 Fantasy Guide,"Please check out u/Hawkie74's guides as well

**Day 2 overview**

tl;dr Daxak K1 Larl Taiga Gojira was the best lineup.

Most of my predictions ended up going the other way, bc vs Spirit was a stomp but the other way around, Liquid dropped to betBoom and BOOM got crushed too hard to score any decent points, apart from Yopaj. 


**Day 3 predictions**

T1 vs fnatic, Tundra vs TA and TSM vs GG. All look to be very close games. 

I expect T1 vs fnatic to have a higher average game time, which means the warding supports whitemon and DJ are instalocks for me. Tofu, PandaMoo, Sneyking, Matthew, Dubu and Saksa also have decent scores but I'm gonna put my faith in the SEA teams for the supports at least.

If you think T1 is gonna win, Karl is the best option for midlaner, DarkMago being a very close second if you expect TA to win. Bryle, BOOM, Armel and Nine will be decent if their teams win but the first 2 are the best case if either of their teams win. 

Pakazs is the stand out option among the cores, his performance this major overall has been very solid as well, the only reason to not play him is if you expect Tundra to run over them. Timado and Dyrachyo are the next 2 options, for either slot pick who you expect to win their matchup, my vote on Dyrachyo. If you're not sure about this matchup and expect Tundra to win, playing both 33 and skiter are also options, 33 being the only decent offlaner fantasy-wise.


**Day 3 recommended players**

Core: Pakasz &gt; Dyrachyo=Timado &gt; 33=skiter

Mid: Karl=DarkMago &gt; Bryle=BOOM=Armel=Nine

Support: DJ=whitemon &gt; tofu=PandaMoo &gt; Sneyking=matthew=saksa

Secret: Arteezy/Nisha/MSS/Crit/Puppey (Coach: Bulba)

Nigma: Miracle/GPK/MC/GH/Jerax (Coach: Kuroky)

Some notes from this:
- Yapzor and Fata in talks to start a stack, other 3 roles are unconfirmed at this moment.

- Iceiceice taking a break for the moment, contemplating offers from SEA and China. Heard SMG is offering him something big.

- QC full disband, Yawar going back to school and Kezhu will try to start another stack.

After we had downloaded the replay of the game, we were convinced of this player's dishonesty. We could see that throughout the game he marked on the minimap all our teleports in the fog of war. He also knew where our wards were and destroyed all of them. Аfter talking to tech support and providing all the evidence of our opponent's dishonest play, we have received the answer that they don't deal with these issues. After our game, these players have played 14 games with the statistics of 10 wins and 4 losses.  There is a proof of a dishonest play in several different matches (6567301950, 6573410347, 6574733236, 6567225691)

DotA2,BKB Needs a Big Ol' Nerf Next Patch,"IMO looking at just how easy it is to get a BKB quickly in current DOTA because of the deluge of gold on the map and how basically every role gets it first or second item, the item needs a mega nerf and/or complete rework.

The biggest way, I think, is changing the items used to build it. Replace Ogre Axe &amp; Mithril Hammer with Reaver and Demon Edge. It turns BKB into a late-game item on the level of a Satanic or Abyssal Blade. Now I understand that means that it makes magic users SUPER great, borderline OP.  So it would require a pretty extensive reworking of the fundamentals of Dotes or perhaps a smaller Minotaur Horn-eque magic immunity item could be bought for use in the interim. 

I'm no expert so maybe what I am saying is absolute gutter trash, but SOMETHING has to be done with this BKB meta. 

Anyone else got any suggestions? Does the item actually not need a nerf but the economy of DOTA needs a shake-up so there is less gold on the map? Or does it just need a minor tweak with how long the spell immunity lasts?",1652822237

# Resources

* I have made a [DPC Fantasy Tracker](https://virendias.github.io/dpc-fantasy/) to help you guys evaluate your results.
* The averages across each player's 25 most recent tier 1 and 2 pro matches is available in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc).
* This guide is purely a quantitative analysis. For a qualitative analysis, I recommend checking out u/flygon727's guides.

# Data Sources

* The numbers in this post are based only on matches played during this Major.
* The data has been acquired from OpenDota and datdota.

#  General Strategy

* **Favour players from teams that will play more series.** Although only the highest-scoring series is counted, players playing more series are more likely to have a better score.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to win their matches.** Core and Mid players score 30–50% more in winning games, and Support players score 10–20% more in winning games.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to play longer matches.**
* **Favour carry players for the Core slots.** This should be the case 99% of the time. Carry players score just as much in losses, as offlane players score in wins.
* **Favour hard support players for the Support slots.** This primarily hinges on which support places the most observer wards for the team, which may not always be the hard support.

# Gold/Silver Card Bonuses

Please refer to this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc) for what to look for for each individual player, or the table below for what to look for for each role in general.

DotA2,Slacks and WR,What is the story between Slacks and WR?,1652809780
DotA2,noobs first first blood,"Gonna preface this by saying this was a warmup bot match. I'm practicing some techniques and advise that a veteran taught me before I jump into another real match. But still getting kills for me is rare since I'm making hoodwink and still new to the game.

So I bought a observer and sentry ward as well as wind lace (I think that's what its called? +20 movement speed) and went scouting for good spots to place them. I found the rune spawn at bottom jungle and placed a rune there, went across the river to place a sentry ward at their likely spot. The battle begins and I immediately notice enemies right where I place my ward, with a teammate running away and another teammate chasing the two attackers like some weird game of mouse-cat-dog. So I rush to help, got in range for the bushwhack, and saved mouse teammate. So now me and dog teammate are ganging on the surprised enemies, and I manage to get the first blood. Bear in mind he was already weak, but still I'm pretty proud of myself for following the advise which lead to this huge moment for me. I have renewed confidence in my abilities and can't wait to start killing in a real match :D",1652809646
DotA2,Question about terminology/panelists draft,When discussing the draft a lot of panelists mention that “x” team will be more about “execution”. What is “execution” in this sense and what is the opposite of that? I know that when people talk about “timer” it means that one team is on a timer meaning they have worse late game but idk what “execution” means and what would be the opposite of an “execution lineup”. Thanks,1652809533
DotA2,80% WR with Dazzle Mid in 7.31 @5k SoloQ,"My opinion: Dazzle Mid is stronger in this patch than in the last few patches.

[https://www.opendota.com/players/37679568?hero\_id=50&amp;patch=50&amp;lane\_role=2](https://www.opendota.com/players/37679568?hero_id=50&amp;patch=50&amp;lane_role=2)

His laning got buffed, because of the lower cooldowns. He benefits from any CDR item, because of how his cooldowns work now. 

Laning Phase: Quite strong, since his Q deals some damage and makes the trade unfavorable the longer it goes. His E also deals a lot of damage if timed right and if the opponent isnt careful with his positioning + pushes a lot. 

Early - Mid Game: This is the heroes weakness. In the last patch you could take a very versatile approach, but now you have to stick with either Aether Lense, Kaya, BoT or the Shard, but if you didnt win the lane, you will most likely try to look for good fights instead of forcing the map.

Mid - Late Game: Octa + Spell Prism and you can grave one target three times in a row. The E with Ether Blade or SnK can deal up to 1.8k magic immunity piercing damage. And Bad Juju reduces armor within 2 seconds by up to 18 points(Three times as much as Assault Curias).

Going Midas can be very strong, because with Aghs and CDR Items it only has a 30s CD and with Good Juju it can even be used twice at once, but in those games where I tried it, it never paid off to sacrifice the Mid Game for it. 

BoTs can be very strong too, since his CDR can stack up and with BoT 2 give him 10s CD on TP(or 0s with Good Juju). 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of friends asked me: ""But what does Dazzle Mid do!?""

Well...

Strong Laning Phase

Can clear Double Ancient Stack with a bit of effort

1.75s Hex in an AOE every 3-5s(If he also uses Grave).

A lot of armor boost and reduction(In most fights around +15 and -15 armor)

Magic Piercing nuke with his Shadow Wave, if you got units around the target(Easy if you have PL or CK Pos 1)

Double and Triple Grave

Insane amounts of Heal",1652808784
DotA2,"ESL/Valve: It really does not make sense why 6 (5, if you count out Mind Games, that is debatable) qualified teams will have zero prize money for this Major. Please have prize money for everyone next time as this is not healthy for the scene","&amp;#x200B;

DotA2,Replay watching,"Hi guys, I wanted to write here with a question about replays.   


First of all, I recently was trying to download a replay to watch, as I remembered that someone played very well in that game, and I wanted to observe their gameplay on a particular hero. However, I am not able to download the replay, it always says that the replay is pending and that it will notify me when the replay is available. The game was from April 24th, and this is the ID 6540109755. Was just too long since the game and the replay is simply not available sometime after the game?   


Also, I thought to ask for some advice for watching replays, and how to analyze them by urself without anyone of higher rank watching it with you.   


Thanks teamsky!",1652807826

First 5 pages are filled with offers placed from the same account which are twice as expensive than others but still are at the top of the list? Is it intended to be like that at all? To me it seems very speculative and encourage scamming. 

P.s. If you check page 8 and further you will find plenty of offers priced at 1,27$ while first 5 pages only filled with 2,34$ which is twice as expensive

Please be carefull when you buy your items on the community market and also check other pages!

This is a smurf that recently got banned along with my Main: [https://steamcommunity.com/id/z3n\_2/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/z3n_2/)

 The smurfs ban: https://imgur.com/8yUMt3g 

As far as i know the ban on the smurf is fair. But why did i get a ranked ban on my main acc for 1 Year?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been playing this game for over 10 years since its pretty much my passion. 

 So why did i get a 1 Year RANKED BAN on my main acc? I have NEVER ABUSED Matchmaking, nor did i use BOOSTING OR ACCOUNT SHARING on my account.

This is the ban i got(Main):   https://imgur.com/iVX4eZo 

As you can tell from my dotabuff i have been ranging around 50% winrate and my mmr was constantly between 6k - 6,5k. I play mostly solo as it is hard for me to climb in party since i lack the teammates. I'd say about 90% of my ranked games in the past 2 years were solo. The only time i play party is mostly when i play unranked, turbo or custom games like CHC. I have created my account in 2009 and i have been playing dota 2 since 2012. My Ingame-Hours are fairly above 15K

I play in 3 Regions: EU-W, EU-E and Russia. You can also see on my dotabuff that i have been playing 30 Matches per day(session) about 2 weeks ago so yes i do play A LOT LOT OF DOTA. Thus why my MMR goes +-300 MMR at days. But i have never been over 6,5k and ive not really ""won"" a lot recently.

Before anyone wants to bash me for smurfing: I absolutely agree with you that it is despicable. But do i really need to get a 1 year ranked ban on my main? Ive never seen that happen to anyone else, nor do i know of any twitch streamer or pro (dont wanna point at other players here) that smurfs and gets their Main banned. Since i mostly play ranked, i feel forced to smurf even harder now, since im unable to play ranked on my main account. But... I really dont want to get banned again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am kind of clueless as of what to do right now, hence the reason why im writing this here. I have already contacted Steam Support but i have been told to go to reddit with this since the Support mostly just Copy-Pastas.",1652791531

DotA2,AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO MISS THE OLD TECHIES?,[removed],1652764446
DotA2,Personal Opinion: Enfeeble is an unnoticed OP spell,"After patches of changes, Enfeeble now reduces attack damage and heal and cast range. Besides, it has an absurdly long cast range and short cooldown at high levels.

Let's put the attack dmg reduction aside as this feature is unchanged through patches, heal and cast range reduction has excellent value in this game. 

The heal reduction effect of the spell is effectively a free spirit vessel with a potentially longer cast range and heal reduction at higher levels. (Leaving all those Pos4 support rushing spirit vessels in tears)

Moreover, it is currently the only (remind me if I am wrong) spell that reduces enemy cast range in the game. Cast range is crucial for spell casters and mobility heroes, and thus by reducing it, the spell heavily undermines their performance in team fights and split pushes. For example, yesterday, the last death of TORONTOTOKYO's puck against Tundra was largely because he got enfeebled by Sneyking's Bane. As a result, the illusory orb cast range was reduced and lasted way shorter than expected (almost half the original duration), leaving him in the middle of the enemy backlines. Another example could be that this spell can disable Earth Spirit's Boulder Smash and Rolling Bounder altogether. I am not sure if it is considered a feature or just an oversight from the devs. 

Anyways, I feel that with this strong Enfeeble (not to mention how powerful the rest of its kit is), bane is definitely one of the top-tier supports for this patch.",1652763943
DotA2,Playing Earth Shaker as Pos 4,"I'm enjoying this playstyle. However, I feel tjat the fact that I pretty much need Arcane Boots and a Blink, to truly be as useful as ES can be a but ""handycappy"" for my team in the early game.

I buy a Headdress, Buckler or Ring when my offlaner needs the extra regen or survivability. Other than that, I don't feel like I contribute much item-wise in the early game.

Of course I do other support stuff, such as stop minions with Fissure, block and pull camps and even go stack triangle when I feel people will start farming them soon.

Any tips on improving or changing lanes maybe? Keep in mind, I don't wanna play a carry role, other than offlane, maybe. Thanks!",1652763718

DotA2,Really excited for Team Undying (TSM),"Been really impressed with this squads showing this major. Kind of surreal to see the transformation from even around TI time last year. Playing OG they looked really in sync and individual performances were on point. Firstly Bryle especially stood out game 1 on VS vs OG. Dude just goes in absolutely fearless and owns them and trusts his team to be there. Its sick af to watch an NA mid play like that. Saberlight  has also performed immaculately. He is like a less greedy version of 33, but in the way that he plays these heroes that can just carry a game (his dark seer is filthy) but with more utility spells. Very Universe-esque.

DotA2,How Valve forces Immortal players to Smurf,"I just got my second account to 7500 MMR, which means if i don't want to fight for role every game (as role queue is disabled when you reach 7500) i have to create another account

7500 was alright few years ago but now it's not that high (its rank 1300 eu)

So suggestion to Valve, please remove cap for role queue or at least set it to 9000 so players like myself can enjoy the game without smurfing",1652759217

DotA2,"Valve, please add a ""Choose Your Arcana (from previous BPs)"" reward in the next battle pass for those who missed out on any of the arcanas.","I think it would be a great idea to have a ""Choose Your Arcana"" reward in the battle pass for people who missed out on previous battlepasses. This would give new players, people who weren't able to afford BPs previously, and people who were on hiatus to obtain arcanas that they missed out on.

It can be say a Level 500 reward, and maybe one more arcana unlock at Level 1000. This is a great incentive for players who desperately want an arcana they missed out on to level up their BPs beyond the new arcanas. 

And for people who already have those arcanas, give them an alternative reward at those levels, maybe a couple immortal treasures? I'm not sure what would be a fair alternative reward for those people. But then again, they don't really need to level up their BP beyond the new arcanas if they don't want to.

Best,

A QoP and Windranger main who took a hiatus and was a working college student in 2020.",1652757206

I mean I don't mind helping someone out with that sort of thing and I hadn't been on steam in a few months ... so it was possible that this person was someone who I just simply couldn't remember.


All of a sudden they sent me some random website to sign up called ""rival-battle.net"" something... immediately I was thinking this seems weird. Why wouldn't I just join through dota. Why the heck do I need to go to some random website. As soon as I said... yeah seems a bit complex ... they didn't answer why or how they just said nah don't worry and suggested that it was for the following tournament:

DotA2,ESL One Stockholm 2022 Main Event Day 2 Fantasy Guide,"**Main Event Day 1 overview**

tl;dr best lineup was Timado Dyrachyo Nine Sneyking PandaMoo

Most of the scores are around the same to the point where there isn't much difference between the top 3 or so of each role, with one exception. Timado outscored everyone else by a decent margin, almost 10 points ahead of the next core. The 2 series winners whose series went to 3 games(Tundra and TA) did better than they usually did as well. The GG T1 series went extremely one sided to the point where only dyrachyo scored well.

**Main Event day 2 predictions**

Another day of 4 series, 8 teams to pick from. Spirit vs bc, betboom vs Liquid, OG vs Boom, T1 vs fnatic.

Spirit vs bc I expect to be a one sided stomp, I'd just avoid players other than maybe Yatoro from this series. T1 vs fnatic on the other hand, should be close and long so Whitemon and DJ are very valuable. For carry and mid players prioritise winning teams, while you prioritse longer games for supports. 

Liquid vs betboom is another series that should be fairly close and Liquid players should be worth a lot in this series.

**Recommended players**

Core: Daxak=Matumbaman &gt; Yuragi=Yatoro &gt; Raven=Jacky=Gabbi &gt; k1

Mid: bzm=Karl &gt; Larl=Armel=Yopaj=M1cke=TorontoTokyo &gt; C.smile

Support: DJ=skem=whitemon &gt; Miposhka=insania=stinger=sonneiko &gt; gojira &gt; boxi=tims

DotA2,ban system is a big dissapointment or how i got banned for 6 months(worth reading),"So i shall start from the beginning. TBH a few months ago i wasnt a decent player, but not the worst. Sometimes I broke items, buy shadow amulet etc. I felt tired and upset so I decided to quit dota for few months. 

2 weeks ago I again started playing. I decided to stop talking in voice chat and play always til the end. And it paid off. I played a lot(5-6 games a day) and my rating and also my behavior started to grow. In 2 weeks from 2500 i got to the 3000 and from 1 behaviour  score to 1500.  I know this is not super much but for me it was enough. 

So i started probably my last game of dota. Played on 5, won my line than go to the side line and middle and helped them too. We won pretty easy and fast. After this game i got this: [https://imgur.com/a/cQtureO](https://imgur.com/a/cQtureO) 

For one moment i thought that this is a mistake but when i pressed okay i saw that i have been banned for 6 months. First of all, this picture is supposed to be a warning but i got banned immediately! after got it. 

Secondly, after that game my behaviour score was updated. Behaviour score has been growed from 1200 to 1500, i had 14 likes and less than 3 reports, 0 abandons. 

Import disclaimer: i didnt ruin games or smth like that for 1 months. than all of my stat started to grow and i honestly dont know for what i got banned. 

My guess(for what i was banned) is a broken ban system. I believe this because after this game my conduct summary show me that i got none report and i dont remember game or games in which i did ruin.

Im kinda shocked but probably everything that is done is for the best. Im curious dear redditors what your thoughts about this. Write if you got smth simillar. Thanks for reading :)

DotA2,Spring Major 2022 Fantasy Guide: 17 May,"TL;DR: Sort each table by the expectation (Exp.) column and pick accordingly.

This guide is purely a quantitative analysis. For a qualitative analysis, I recommend checking out u/flygon727's guides.

# Resources

* I have made a [DPC Fantasy Tracker](https://virendias.github.io/dpc-fantasy/) to help you guys evaluate your results.
* The averages across each player's 25 most recent tier 1 and 2 pro matches is available in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc).

# Data Sources

* The numbers in this post are based only on matches played during this Major.
* The data has been acquired from OpenDota and datdota.

#  General Strategy

* **Favour players from teams that will play more series.** Although only the highest-scoring series is counted, players playing more series are more likely to have a better score.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to win their matches.** Core and Mid players score 30–50% more in winning games, and Support players score 10–20% more in winning games.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to play longer matches.**
* **Favour carry players for the Core slots.** This should be the case 99% of the time. Carry players score just as much in losses, as offlane players score in wins.
* **Favour hard support players for the Support slots.** This primarily hinges on which support places the most observer wards for the team, which may not always be the hard support.

# Gold/Silver Card Bonuses

Please refer to this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc) for what to look for for each individual player, or the table below for what to look for for each role in general.

DotA2,Pro Tip Discovered:,"DotA 2 is more of a physical game than people realize.

Obviously, doing all that you can to bring about acute mental awareness is important at all competitive levels (especially the pro levels), and there is plenty you can do to help achieve this (physical fitness being one of them—as you hone your body, so does your mind sharpen). We know all of this...

... but what you might not realize is the important if fingernails.

I swear; every time I cut my fingernails, I lose way more games. The extra support that it gives you for manual dexterity is unsurpassable. But don’t take my word for it; test it out yourself. Once you’ve proven this to yourselves with much higher win rates w/ longer nails, you might be tempted to be a pampered-Polly and go to a nail salon. My boiis, don’t do this! This is one of the most noob mistakes that you can make. What you need are those gnarled, half-chewed, golemn-toe-like, pizza-sauce-infused, yellow-brown fingernails. During long DotA sessions, don’t underestimate the benefit of the light (but flavorful) snack of these bacteria-filled crunchy delights. And so, this is a call to all of you DotA Allstars boomers to remember your roots, as a HS greaseball, sneaking on your family computer to play WC3 at 2am on your new DSL Internet. However, you must remember one thing most-of-all ... your fingernails. You don’t suck now due to  “losing it” in your old age. You suck cuz you have a desire to make the lady onlookers a bit more interested in you at this stage in your life, rather than being repulsed by these harpy talons caked with booger-blood and Cheeto dust. And so, this is a call to all of my fellow mid-30s manchildren to turn back the clock and bring back the grime-mongers that we truly are at heart. 

Seriously, though... fingernails help.

Unnecessarily salty like he has a chip on his shoulder or something,"I was watching his stream vs OG and he seems incredibly against Notail for some reason, like he's throwing shade everytime.

Gorgc : Who's the best captain you've ever played with?

Sumail : I think Johann (Notail), he's like so postive and good vibes you know?

Gorgc : I mean you would be after you've won 2 Ti's (says it seriously, not jokingly,)

Sumail : ......

Notail was positive way before he won those TI's, everyone knows that. 


Another Interaction : We see Notail come on camera in the booth wearing a headset as acting coach

Gorgc : Wait..Notail is here??

Sumail : Yeah ofcourse he's the standin coach

Gorgc : Yeah  but you know he didnt have any hand in OG's strats Etc, he's there purely for show

Sumail : ...No..he's the coach (or sth like that)

Gorgc : Another salty reply I dont remember

DotA2,Hero Concept: Truthseer (the Crone),"Truthseer-Crone stooped with age and leaning onto her staff to move about. Very low mobility but strong area control with an emphasis on 'seeing' the truth of all things around her. Personality is a bit cynical as she 'tells it like it is' and doesn't sugar coat any line. Eastern European 'hag' voice and aesthetic vibe. Large crow named Doris sits on her shoulder and plays into her kit.

Q-'Still Plucky'- Doris swoops to attack the target's eyes, dealing low damage, reducing their cast range, and giving Truthseer or the ally closest a buff of 2/4/6/8/10 +50% target armor for a 12s duration (CD 16/15/14/13/12s, buff can self stack)

W-'Wizened Gaze'-passive: reveals hidden enemies within 400/500/600/700/750 units of Truthseer. Active: reveals all enemies Truthseer perceives to allies and increases the damage all enemies in range take by 10% for 5s. 30s CD.

*Shard*: Increase range by 200 units and silences only enemies revealed for 2s as well.

E-'Stinging Truths'-Enemies' flaws are laid bare as Truthseer cuts the targets non-primary stats by 42.5/50/57.5/65/72.5% for 8s and deals them magic damage equal to numeric value subtracted each second. 20

R-'Laid Bare'-Truthseer clicks a target and dispels all active buffs, destroys all illusions, and renders them unable to take on any new buffs, healing, or illusions for 3/5/7s. Pierces BkB and affects a primary target even if an illusion is targeted.

*Scepter*: Doris the Crow will glow and continually fly over any hero with Illusions' main body and peck them for 30/40/50 magic damage a second if they are in range of Truthseer's W-'Wizened Gaze' passive.",1652730645

DotA2,dota 2 tracks new accounts created on the same computer/ip,[removed],1652730283
DotA2,Trying dota as a league player,"Been playing league for the past 11 seasons and am not happy with the direction the game has moved in so finally let my friend introduce me to dota. 

Firstly I am envious you guys actually have a functioning client unlike what league has.

However I feel like the rest of the game struggles a ton with just readability issues that start from the moment you enter the pick/ban phase. In league you queue as a main role and off role and get put into a lobby with a full team with their roles already assigned and marked clearly on the screen beside the player name. You start by pre picking your character and then the ban phase starts with very clear visual and audio queues to mark the start and end of it where as in dota I felt like it just threw me in in the middle of it and it was just very hard to track what was going on.

Actually figuring out what role a character in dota fills on a team is also a nightmare. On league the champs are very clearly catergorized into the different roles such as toplane/midlane/jungle/support and then those categories are further categorized into sub sections such as toplane being divided into tanks/juggernauts/fighters or midlaners being divided into mages/assassins/skirmishers.

Once youre in game actually being able to tell what a character on your screen does also feels very difficult, a lot of abilities and such just feel like they lack good visual indication. The fact that you cant easily get an overview of the game state by being able to view items, farm and k/d/a of your team and the enemy team in the scoreboard just makes tracking the state of the game a nightmare comparatively and the map just doesnt feel as user friendly.

The game has its strong suits though, I feel like itemization is a loooot more interesting in dota and character designs at least on paper seem more interesting. But as a gameplay experience I feel like for a new player league is just infinitely easier to read and therefore learn. Only been playing dota for a couple days now but I still barely know how the pick/ban works and have no clue what is going on 99% of a game.",1652730087

DotA2,A modest and very serious proposal about the state of competitive DOTA &amp; the DPC,"I think I echo the concerns of a lot of members within the community when I bring up the current slot distribution for major &amp; TI invites. Recent results within tournaments I think cast doubt on whether the current slot distribution is fair or whether some regions receive free DPC points.

I think the evidence is now clear after EUs two strongest teams, OG and Gaimin Gladiators, were sent to the lower bracket in best of 3 series by mid tier NA &amp; SA teams. The only logical conclusion is to take all of EUs slots and divide them between the NA &amp; SA regions. EU can play open qualifiers with another weak region that didn't have any teams attend this major - China. It's fairly obvious after these tournament results that this is the fairest and best solution so that DOTA can keep developing strong talent in the most serious international regions. thank you for listening.",1652729731
DotA2,Twitch-Chat is just insane,"I just cant understand, why 90% of Twitch-Chat is just pure flaming/blaming or laughing about Pro-Players and their (little) mistakes. Every missed CS, every lost fight, every death is just used to laugh about the players. There is nearly no praising of the teams like it is in nearly every other sport. 

Everytime i go into a twitch progame, my chat is open because i use it in other channels. And everytime i need to close it after seconds. Like im pretty sure at least 50% of these people are even adults (over 18y) but it looks so childish to me.

And i dont even want to start about the flaming of the teams and regions. Its just insane for me.

Is it too hard to cheer for the players and their plays, who put so much work into it and are at that much pressure?

Are here some of these people of Twitch-Chat so they can explain me this behaviour?

Sorry for my rant, i watched lot of Major at work and on my phone the chat always popped up and tilted me\^\^.",1652729668

DotA2,Can we see harsher punishments for griefers?,"So I'm a player that's gone from Herald to Divine(currently hovering around late legend/early Ancient) so I've seen a lot of different types of pubs over the last 6.5 years of playing, one of the things I loved about SEA was that even if players would say ""gg end"" they would keep tryharding until the end. Last couple of years I had university so I stopped playing actively, I returned about seven months ago and really seriously started playing solo about a month ago. Over my last 25 games I've seen:   


* A Phoenix start feeding us because his Earthshaker didn't follow up on some kill he was trying to set up and he got killed in the process. The Phoenix continued to feed the entire game because of this.
* An aggressive Earthshaker was trying to create as many teamfights as possible and we asked him to calm down a bit until we got items, one of our players asked him to ""stop feeding"" and he got mad and said ""go win without me"" and decided to go farm jungle entire game avoiding any and all conflict
* A Juggernaut decided to not play anymore because the offlane Tidehunter on his team went for Sange Kaya over a blink causing him to not be there to ult fast enough to save Jugg and so Jugg decided his team didn't deserve to win anymore

  
I mean these are some examples that stand out, but I notice this every 1/6 games either on my team or enemy team and I have a 10,000 behavior score. I've reported a number of these players and only once did I get a notification that a player had been punished.   


Griefers need to be punished harder because they ruin the game for the other people who have to endure maybe an hour long game with little hope in sight of winning. I think as a start additional punishment to griefers should consist of the following:   


1. If griefer's team wins everyone gains an additional 7 MMR(rounded down) and the griefer still receives a -30.
2. If griefer's team loses everyone other than the griefer only lose 23 MMR and the griefer loses 60 MMR.

  
I think if the griefer stands to lose 60 MMR for any game that they throw they'll be more hesitant to do it, as they'll need to play two games(possibly use up their role queues) to get it back. We could also see 1 week bans from gameplay, disabling role queue for a day(assuming they use it) or other punishments you guys can think of.",1652726023

DotA2,Even Valve doesn't want to produce TI 10 True Sight,"I'm still salty that Team Spirit won TI. I can't help it. Wings gaming was my favorite TI team of all time, and the new LGD iteration was basically Wings 2.0. They ran through everyone the entire year, no one was a challenge to them. Even the current favorites Tundra barely managed to defeat them 3-2 (when LGD was playing without their mid and still managed to take 2 games off Tundra).  


Anyway, it broke my heart to see this team lose in TI finals. And the finals were overall disappointing. Just a highlight of TS abusing a broken mechanic - Magnus skewer. Anytime that mechanic was countered or banned, TS basically looked like the tier 2 team it is.   


Obviously you will disagree and call me a hater. But just look at the results of TS after TI. They are losing to unknown tier 3 teams like ThunderA, TSM FTX, GG esports and barely managing to be the best even in their region, let alone the world.   


That was such a disappointing TI, where an unworthy team won the championship. Even Valve is having a hard time putting a positive spin on it. How do you justify that every game that they won was due to a broken OP ability? How many times can you show a Magnus skewer? How can you glorify a one trick team like TS winning the most glorious Dota2 event? While teams that actually had skills and continue to perform at the highest level lost.  


Team Spirit winning TI just makes Dota2 look bad and that's why True Sight is so delayed.",1652724667

DotA2,Improvement on Lina's arcana,"Considering the quality of the newer arcanas, I honestly think Lina's arcana is due for an improvement. More effects, better model, something. It costs the same as other available arcanas. Anyone else agree??",1652715936

DotA2,Is anyone from Chicago and want to set up a Lan Tournament?,"I want to set up a Lan Tournament in Chicago. Do a once or twice a month thing, like perhaps at a few local libraries or Comic shops or something. But, a lot would go into that, including finding a venue.   


I presume it would have to be bring your own computer, at least for first. For it to be more than an idea though, i'd need people interested in participating and helping set it up.",1652714713

DotA2,Ravage stun bugged (?) potentially happened in the ESL Stockholm Major,"Thunder Predator vs Bet Boom game 2

at minute 35-36 there was a clash happened in Radiant's triangle (near Radiant secret shop), where Tidehunter used Ravage hitting 4 heroes *but* as soon as they came falling down from the tentacles **they were already moving and were not stunned**.

Can anyone confirm this?",1652714401
DotA2,My Arcade lobby is not visible. Why?,"I am able to join other lobbies but if I created one it is not visible in search and thus no one would join.

DotA2,enigma + witch doctor = ez kills,,1652710358
DotA2,the concept of damage reduction feels kinda broken,"this ""reduce enemy dmg in an aoe"" concept feels too strong and should be tuned down or even removed imo. wraith pact makes your team take 30% less dmg FROM ALL SOURCES. literally just removing nearly a third of the enemy teams damage. compare that to glimmer cape which gives 50% reduction from only magic to only 1 guy.

what are you gonna spend 4k gold on as a support/offlaner that gives more impact than flat 30% damage reduction in a fight? yes it dies in 5 hits but the aoe is huge so you can place it far back in a way that makes it hard for the enemy to commit on it and kill it. they prob need to go in and pop bkb to kill it etc. not to mention the benefits from vlad aura + random 30dps in the aoe. it's would be strong enough without the damage but for some reason you get a half radiance with much bigger aoe for free.

pugna ward is broken for the same reason. not many pos 5 heroes will consistently have as much impact in a team fight as reducing 25% of all enemy magic dmg just by 1 button press. imagine a draft where you have pugna and underlord and buy wraith pact + mage slayer on some heroes. enemy team will have 0 damage. wraith pact needs to be nerfed or removed imo. rn i feel like it's almost a necessary pickup every game, because if enemy team has one and your team doesnt it just means your heroes and spells are at 70% of normal strength while enemy is at 100% strength (not even including the vlad dmg buff etc).",1652710314

The Q was the old ability from Lancer with a twist. It was castable on allys. So you can make someone invis and create a weak illusion from it.

the W was just a simple stun like venge

the E was a passive that just buffed all Illusions in a radius. Make them take less dmg and deal more dmg.

The ultimate did make a illusion of everything in a aoe.

&amp;#x200B;

The meta was to pick a CK, ult with ck  aghs and then use the ultimate to create a army and just push them to death.

DotA2,How to get your core get reported guaranteed,"original post in chinese: [http://c.tieba.baidu.com/p/7834876239?pn=1](http://c.tieba.baidu.com/p/7834876239?pn=1)

&gt;First of all, pick support, in the lane steal his creeps, when you get levels use spells to clear the wave and push out the lane, and then your core will be cursing, at this time you do not make a sound do not argue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Your core will be angry, leave the lane to you, and jungle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Next, follow him in the jungle, and steal his neutral creeps, at this time other two lanes are busy laning, nobody cares what you are doing, you can only play this ""trick"" before min 15.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of the times, your core's mentality is collapsed, he'll either solo the rest of the game or just start to feed, he will also constantly curse in chat, make a bad impression on your teammates.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then you play normally, follow the team and join team fights so that your other teammates will feel that you are not the problem, while your core is not only useless, but also has been toxic the whole game, and finally, he's going to be reported guaranteed.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In the worst case, both you and your core get reported.

Saw this post from a chinese dota2 community, I absolutely hate players like this OP but as a core player, I really feel it. Although to be honest I don't have many support players who do exactly like this post from the beginning of the game intentionally just to ruin me, I think this post reflects the fact that nobody cares what happens in the lane, if ur playing a core(safe/off) position and you are behind in NW or having a terrible KDA you will be blamed by the whole team, and even reported for ""account buying/intentionally griefing"" while rarely someone would question supports gameplay.",1652690012

DotA2,I wish tournaments would post who is commentating upcoming matches,"Casters have a huge impact on how much I enjoy a dota match.

Maybe I am just blind and it is easily found out, but in case I haven't just missed it, it really should be info that is readily available and found on the tournament website/liquipedia.

/rant off",1652689372
DotA2,Is there a way to level up Dota Plus Hero levels faster?,"I've been playing Earth Shaker for 3 days in a row now, probably around 20 games and I think I've only done like 2 levels, from 6 to 8.

Is there something I'm forgetting? I've done all the Dota Plus quests a long time ago.",1652689121
DotA2,This kid will be bullied for not buying enough wards,,1652687879
DotA2,What is the name of this song?,The first song [in this dotawtf video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiVsclKct9o&amp;t=219s) is really catchy and some russian song can anyone please do tell which is this song,1652686619
DotA2,you're ain't a real Dota player if you don't name your child after a Dota hero,,1652685987
DotA2,"It's great that we can rename replays as we like when we download them to discern them - it would be amazing if we could also group them in different user-defined categories for easier organizing (e.g. pro games, specific hero, specific player etc.)","Replays are an incredibly useful resource, so it would be so nice to see improvements to this gem of a feature",1652685571

DotA2,his is the best GameGuild I ever seen @Skill_Labs_gg Get free,[removed],1652685305
DotA2,"After 6 years playing dota2,7036hours I have some conclusions.","   
First of all, I'm not going to stop playing this game because it's amazing. 

Second, the game has a forced 50% winrate, so games are fixed, win streaks and losing streaks are no fluke. 

 Third , 2 weeks ago I added a herald4 who is now guardian 5 and he tells me he is 5k mmr . Guardian, Crusader and Archon is full of smurf from divine, ancient. 

 Fourth, to upload mmr you need third party applications like overwolf to tell you which heroes are the favorites of your enemies and ban them. This is not cheating, and all players should use it if you want to go from 1000mmr to 5k. 

five ,  All Russian boosters should die. 

six ,  It doesn't matter how good a player you are, the game will put you in games so that you lose yes or yes, and at this point there is the lie of the medals. You never win because you played well, you win because the game has put 4 feeders on the other team. 

 seventh, despite playing for 6 years, my first account has 10 mmr, and my official account has 4000 mmr. Games at 10mmr are harder than at 4000mmr, because there are smurfs and boosters. At the same time, 10mmr games are more fun than 4000mmr games. 

 I have nothing more to add , the game is amazing , but valve does not make any effort to create a fair and balanced system .

DotA2,"Unpopular Opinion: RTZ nor Bulba's draft isn't the problem, but Nightfall","I mean that guy is farming bracers and will just farm dagger after that, he in effect is acting also like a carry, he should be creating space for arteezy to farm, make movements in the map, the way he plays, it's just awful man.

If u will study his gameplay, he is very passive and reactive to the ganks, he does not initiate it.

They played the farming game against any other team, I miss the old EG wherein the pos 3 player actively participates in the map and does not play the farm game against the enemy core.   


Game 2 of EG vs BC (Do or Die match), Nightfall played the farming game against TA, he should have bought dagger and then made his presence felt in the map.

DotA2,Help with farming and question about Marci,"Hi there, totally noob player here. Sorry for any grammar errors. English is not my main language.

I'm new do Dota 2. I'm pretty much enjoying the game so far but there a few things that I keep strugling with. One of them is farming the jungle. I'm currently playing as HC because I can feel confortable with this role. I know that farming is mandatory to this role in particular, so I centred all of my focus to learn how to farm properly. But the problem is: I simply can't farm the jungle camps.

I will be using Phantom Assassin as an example since she is the hero I'm playing the most. I keep struggling to farm the jungle with her before 14\~15min in the game (when, normaly, I'm able to buy the Battle Fury). The camps deal to much damage and I really miss the BF's AoE damage. I usually able to farm the camps after a time but my HP bar ends up getting really low and I don't think that buying a lot of healing items is the right decision. So, in the end, I don't farm the camps until i get my BF.

I fell like I'm doing something wrong. I use my abilites in the right time to farm. E to avoid getting camp aggro, W to get attack speed and Q to some extra damage. But I'm always end with low hp. Am I right to not farm the camps until I get BF or there's something I need to do different? 

Also, about Marci. I tried a lot of heroes when I started playing (about a week ago) and Marci was the one I had the most fun playing with. But, as I said, I'm a HC player. I discovered that the people usually play with her as a support. So, my second question is: is viable doing Marci as a HC?

Thanks for reading. Everything is helpful.",1652663025

DotA2,How is everyone so damn good at this game now,"I’ve just started playing more after pretty much a 5 year break. Had to take some time to learn all the new things (there’s a ton).

Naturally, I expected my MMR to go down significantly, as I’m super rusty, there’s a lot of new stuff and also there’s MMR inflation.

I was about 3.5k solo at the time. Recalibrated at around 2.5k, have been steadily going down to about 1.4k now (my friend who’s back to playing with me is 500!! He used to be 3.8k).

I’ve been losing quite a lot. But what I’ve noticed is that, everyone is so fucking good? Like what the hell? People barely warded in 2k back then. Here are things you’d be INSANE to see in a 1k bracket, let alone people with 500(!!) MMR doing.

-Warding outside of main ward hills
-Dewarding
-Denies on top and bottom lanes
-Supports harassing offlanes out of their lanes
-Actual meaningful buybacks on early games
-Supports pulling for their carry
-Supports stacking
-Cores stacking for themselves

The list goes on and on. These are small things, but things you’d never see at that bracket. It’s just mind blowing to me. Just a last thing that happened recently that doesn’t mean THAT much, but it’s insane to me that 500mmrs are doing it: I’ve seen a Slark while chasing me, deny 2 creeps in the middle of the fight. Like are you kidding me. Sub 1k mmr people thinking like this?

DotA2,ESL One Stockholm 2022 Main Event Day 1 Fantasy Guide,"**Day 4 overview**

tl;dr Dyrachyo 33 BOOM Sonneiko Tofu was the best lineup

EG are eliminated as they went 1-1 and finished in last place, you can dust their cards now. The 6 way tie was avoided as GG 2-0 fnatic but a 4 way tie occured as TA and TSM ended up 1-1 and proceeded to end up first and second in the resulting tiebreaks, finishing 2nd and third in their group after GG, while Spirit secured the last upper bracket slot. Liquid looked shaky and outdrafted in all the tiebreaks, but hopefully they can play like their previous form later in the tournament. The other games didn't really affect the upper/lower bracket placements apart from the seeding to decide matchups and we are left with the Main event now.


**Main Event Day 1 predictions**

4 games, 8 teams. Tundra vs Spirit, TA vs betBoom, OG vs TSM and GG vs T1. There's a wide variety of high scorers in all roles and teams so try to prioritise teams you expect to win from the options that will be mentioned.

From cores Pakazs and Daxak are the highest scoring cores by far, going purely off results TA seems to be the stronger team so Pakazs is definitely an option. Since daxak is playing against him and might not score that much in a loss you can pass him over for the high scoring cores in other teams, namely dyrachyo for GG and 33 for Tundra or even skiter. The last card I would consider is Timado from TSM but I'd much prefer to stick to Pakazs + Dyrachyo/33/skiter.

All mid laners other than Nine are viable. Karl is pointwise the best but the highest scoring one will be from a winning team most likely. so factor that into your selection, DarkMago is prob a more reliable pick in that aspect. The winning team of OG/TSM(bzm/Bryle) is also another good option to consider.

As for supports, we're less result-oriented here and more looking for long games. Whitemon and Tofu are the best options, Saksa, PandaMoo and Dubu can also be played.


**Main Event Day 1 recommended players**

Core: Pakazs &gt; Daxak=Dyrachyo=33 &gt; skiter=Timado &gt; Yatoro=Yuragi &gt; Gabbi

Mid: Karl=bzm=DarkMago &gt; Bryle=Boom &gt; TorontoTokyo=Larl &gt; Nine

* Building upgrading / base building: a unit that can spend gold (or a unique resource they gain alongside gold) to upgrade towers and buildings.

* Mind Control: been hinted at for years, maybe too hard to balance though

* Time travel: Glimpse and time lapse kind of? But something more extreme. Maybe the ability to completely rewind the game by several seconds

DotA2,Tips for better coms?,"I've been playing a lot of mid recently and winning 9/10 of the games I play which is great everything going well there.

This issue I'm seeing repeatedly in a few of my games though is when the enemy midlaner realised they can't stay in lane with me anymore they'll grab a rune and go gank a sidelane.

when this is really obvious I call out through different ways the ""X hero is missing"", Missing mid chatwheel, typing X hero is going top with a haste get back, saying it over the mic and just pinging the shit out of the lane they're on their way to. But a good 50% of the time my team just doesn't care, stays for another 30 seconds and inevitably gets caught and feeds the enemy mid a nice double kill getting them the much needed boost to get back into the game

Support heroes I'm considering based on win rate: 

* **Abaddon (48 games/67% win rate)**
* **Mirana (197 games/54% win rate)**
* **Witch Doc (45 games/60% win rate)**
* Dazzle (42 games/59% win rate)
* Bane (22 games/59% win rate)
* Lich (24 games/58% win rate)
* Jakiro (19 games/58% win rate)
* Omniknight (28 games/57% win rate)
* Shadow Shaman (30 games/57% win rate)
* **Earthshaker (54 games/56% win rate)**
* Nyx Assasin (36 games/56% win rate)
* Warlock (18 games / 56% win rate)
* Keeper of the Light (18 games / 56% win rate)

The ones in bold are the ones I've played the most but I'm not sure how they're perceived in today's game. I haven't been watching any of the Stockholm Major but looking at stats, Shadow Shaman and Mirana are heroes that I have played before that have a good amount of wins. Would it even matter at the 3-4k MMR level?

Any suggestions on what heroes I should play so that I can +25 instead of -25?",1652650008

# Resources

* I have made a [DPC Fantasy Tracker](https://virendias.github.io/dpc-fantasy/) to help you guys evaluate your results.
* The data I have used to make this post is available in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc).

# Data Sources

* The numbers are based only on matches played during this Major.
* The data has been acquired from OpenDota and datdota.

#  General Strategy

* **Favour players from teams that will play more series.** Although only the highest-scoring series is counted, players playing more series are more likely to have a better score.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to win their matches.** Core and Mid players score 30–50% more in winning games, and Support players score 10–20% more in winning games.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to play longer matches.**
* **Favour carry players for the Core slots.** This should be the case 99% of the time. Carry players score just as much in losses, as offlane players score in wins.
* **Favour hard support players for the Support slots.** This primarily hinges on which support places the most observer wards for the team, which may not always be the hard support.

DotA2,Request: unlock items in inventory using inventory slot hotkey,"I am malcoordinated and would enjoy being able to unlock a Vitality Booster for Aeon Disk at the press of a button rather than having to quickscope my backpack and speedrun the dropdown menu minigame  


It would only have to be implemented for items which don't have uses for it to do the job, but a way of making it so you could also unlock hood to make pipe for double activate could be some option like ""unlock item on quickcast"" so players can unlock using the quickcast item hotkeys

DotA2,Do you people even use the in-game watch for pro scene?,"almost every major i post complaints about how broken the in-game watch is and every single time it gets downvoted to oblivion.

the way broadcast voice works is random, sometimes it works fine and sometimes casters are switched randomly. 

some times the voice of the casters sounds robotic and you have to restart the game to fix it.

and why does it have to be delayed so long for viewers, disable the watch tab for players who are playing so players can't snipe and let people watch live.

for us third-world countries, the internet is expensive, I can't afford to watch Twitch for 3 hours and I like to switch into perspective mode sometimes. even the in-game twitch stream is set to 1080p and can't be changed sometimes, and by the way, can't players snipe with that?! and if not then how come the in-game watch is delayed?

also you can't watch the late game if the game ended 5 min ago or sth, client says there is a live game but when you press the watch in-game it says lobby not found, because game ended.

DotA2,Phoenix background main menu,,1652601728
DotA2,Stockholm Major - Group B Day 4 Possible Final Standings,,1652600928
DotA2,Game completely gone missing,"Played a ranked game about 18 hours ago, game was perfectly normal and I got the win but at the end of the game, the common bug where the results weren't loading due to high load appeared. I thought the game would eventually be scored but it doesn't even show up on my Dota profile lmao. It's just completely erased from existence. Has this happened to anyone else?",1652597553
DotA2,"Guess the hero!? (35 minute items, Ancient 2 rank)",,1652597477
DotA2,Why NO ONE can get out of Herald (you’re the problem),"Hi I play dota and I’m herald 3, I just had an epiphany. Like most epiphanies, upon realization it all seems so obvious. “How do I get out of this bracket?” “why am I stuck in herald?”  if you research anywhere on the internet you’re going to see the same result “you have to win by yourself, play mid! topson could 1v5 and win it doesn’t matter who you pick or what you do you can do anything in herald and still win” no other bracket in dota has this mentality. This idea that you don’t have to play as a team to win you just have to carry, that’s the issue. Heralds are wondering “how can I win when everyone on my team is 0/15/3 and no one will buy wards?” Of course your support isn’t gonna ward and of course everyone is gonna steal your farm and of course no one is gonna work as a team because everyone is under the impression that the only way to win is to accept the ~fact~ that they have no team and that they are humanity’s only hope to win this game. No one in herald thinks they should be in herald and that’s a problem. Heralds think they’re too good for their shitty herald team.

If you want mmr be humble,be reactive, have Pma, be flexible, understand the roles, and work as a team.",1652597364
DotA2,Bulba and EG,"I saw in true sight of Nigma vs OG that Ceb, Notail and Kuroky take opinions of the players who want to play a hero. 
Is it possible that Abed has an inclination to play spirits+ puck and rtz loves illusions and Bulba picks them based on their preference? Or is it just one guy doing the entire draft? I see lot of hate for Bulba but I doubt if it is one guy's work.",1652596828
DotA2,TIL how useful hurricane bird is,,1652596283
DotA2,Techies and Lina Scepter Upgrades Idea,"# TECHIES-

***Current:***  *Reactive Tazer can be cast on allies and deals 300 damage on detonation.*

***Suggested:*** *Minefield Sign allows Proximity Mines inside its AoE to be cast without the range restriction. Up to 3 mines. 175 AoE.*

A bit of its old Aghanim's Upgrade, granting Minefield Sign some use again.

&amp;#x200B;

# LINA-

Now that magical damage goes through magic immunity, why not give her old Aghanim's Scepter Upgrade back? Additionally, Kaya builds into Ethereal and you can't combo with the Pure Damage from her upgraded Laguna Blade.

Basically, the current upgrade is only good against Anti-Mage and some Pipe carriers, compared to the old one.

***Current:***  *Changes Laguna Blade's damage type to Pure, and allows it to slice through spell immunity.*

***Old (updated):*** *Increases Laguna Blade damage by 250 and allows it to pierce magic immunity.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Interesting idea:** Wouldn't it be fun if Viper had a way to fold his wings and slither like a snake? Maybe poisoning himself as its cost, and make some use of his magic resistance.",1652594566
DotA2,Have they forgotten about the destroyer?,,1652592022
DotA2,Quicker camera movement,"I think we need a quick camera control, making the camera to jump at the current mouse location.

All current camera controls work around dragging (AWSD, Edge pan and also Camera grip), which means some time is spent in order to reach the exact desired camera position.

By having camera centered on current mouse cursor location, one might be able to perform quicker movements, both to go in and to go out (similarly of using double hero selection to center camera on heroes after watching around the map).

Please, Valve, listen to this suggestion and make it a possible camera control option while keeping the other ones!",1652591168

DotA2,Wraith Pact Itemization,"Personally, never seen this item ever bought in pub games but it seems to be a very popular item in the current Major. 4050 gold for 30% Outgoing Damage Reduction. 

#*Is wraith pact actually worth the gold?*",1652587766
DotA2,"Is there ""good smurfing""?","I've been a support player since when I started playing in 2014. I would occasionally play 3 dk or axe but 95% of the time it's pos 4/5. When I finally got to 5k I felt like I hit a wall. After talking to my friends they told me to try to play more core so I understand what the cores want better. I tried playing carry a couple of times and got flamed so hard I almost gave up. Then one of my Archon friends gave me his account for me to practice playing pos 1. I was still bad but I started winning a few games and I felt like my carry abilities are indeed Archon level.  

Two days ago when I logged on my ""smurf“ the account was perma banned. I never had crazy k/d/a scores and only a couple of rampages as pa/sven, which is bound to happen if you have a good game. I know smurfing is bad, but was my behavior really smurfing if I lose about 50% of my games playing the role that I suck at and want to practice? 

No flaming pls. I just want to hear you guys' opinions.",1652587703

DotA2,Hypothetical Post TI Qualifiers Reshuffle,"Inevitably teams will leave, disband, reload, or rebuild. Teams failing to qualify for TI or elongated earlier than anticipated will face some hard decisions. 

My dream of dreams would be:

EG feels like they want to play fast but keep defaulting into their rut. Not pointing fingers but they have arguably some of the strongest natural position 4s on the team and that means someone (likely both) isn’t being utilized to its maximum potential. A rebuild seems inevitable and I hope Jerax continues playing in a 3 or 4 position outside of EG. 

If Nigma Galaxy can’t get it to gel I hope they disband. Love them all but I think there are some good years left on some players that could be better realized on other teams. 

Ceb and Topson have been very active in pubs. NoTail not as much, I am sure gardening is his new OG Seed, but try a Last Dance scenario. Get the band back together. 

Old Guard (OG) or Champ Champs should be: Miracle, Topson, Ceb, Jerax, and NoTail. 

One DPC season. See what happens. Would love even the new OG vs old OG. 

That’s the dream.",1652583446

You are only shooting yourself in the foot because it will be put in an EXCLUSIVE chest that filled with non marketable items and also made so rare that you will need to spend an unjustifiable amount to get it it.

DotA2,Spring Major 2022 Fantasy Guide: 15 May,"TL;DR: Sort each table by the expectation (Exp.) column and pick accordingly.

This guide is purely a quantitative analysis. For a qualitative analysis, I recommend checking out u/flygon727's guides.

# Resources

* I have made a [DPC Fantasy Tracker](https://virendias.github.io/dpc-fantasy/) to help you guys evaluate your results.
* The data I have used to make this post is available in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc).

# Data Sources

* The numbers are based on each player's 25 most recent tier 1 and 2 pro matches.
* The data has been acquired from OpenDota and datdota.

#  General Strategy

* **Favour players from teams that will play more series.** Although only the highest-scoring series is counted, players playing more series are more likely to have a better score.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to win their matches.** Core and Mid players score 30–50% more in winning games, and Support players score 10–20% more in winning games.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to play longer matches.**
* **Favour carry players for the Core slots.** This should be the case 99% of the time. Carry players score just as much in losses, as offlane players score in wins.
* **Favour hard support players for the Support slots.** This primarily hinges on which support places the most observer wards for the team, which may not always be the hard support.

# Gold/Silver Card Bonuses

Please refer to this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc) for what to look for for each individual player, or the table below for what to look for for each role in general.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Brayan Riascos Ruiz, I am from a small town in Peru, Saposoa, I am writing this message to the Dota 2 community to please request we get Region Locking as well as a mandatory english exam before being allowed into ranked in the US servers. The amount of toxic behavior in my games is absolutely crazy. I speak fluent engish as I studied at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, to learn English and I get punished for it by my fellow peruvian players. always being toxic to me for speaking english to my team.  

&amp;#x200B;

The US servers should be for american players, and players who speak english and are able to coordinate. I propose we add a english exam as well as region locking so only players smart enough to use a VPN can play on US servers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you,

DotA2,The current EG roster is the largest waste of potential in the history of dota.,"The entire team looking like bunch of mmo characters that got voided because they put points in wrong stats.




Nightfall is straight up not an offlane player.



Abed was known for his flashy mids, but then they let him play space creating Storm Spirit for like half a year, now he doesn't even know what he plays anymore.



RTZ should be streaming instead of playing carry for a serious professional team.





JerAx was one of the best pos 4 in the world but he retired and they dug him up and they put him on pos 5 for months, how do you expect him to be at the same level he was after looking like he is still in retirement?




Cr1t is the only player that's truly versatile in the team, but he's just a smoke breaker now. Like come the fuck on man.",1652534571
DotA2,"Shoutout to Fly's casting, already one of the best analysts in the scene",I really enjoy that he is clearly having fun but also provides really great insight into the goals of the players and a deeper insight. Would love him to join the scene full time when he retires.,1652534491

I clicked a few times the -60s button to see the start of the match (it allows you to go beyond the boundaries of the time displayed)

and Tiny was 1v2 the whole time vs a Void spirit mid on radiant ..and his bane trying to steal last hits

then i looked top dire an Axe pos5 jungling 

bot dire Bounty and Sniper with quellings trying to last hit while the lone radiant Ck gets hyper bullied


... then BH decided to tp mid and steal last hits from Tiny who tilted and bought shadow amulet after breaking items


What the hell do you even do in these cases? I mean theres like only 1-2 people actually playing among the 10",1652526424
DotA2,Key overlapping on laptop,"Hey guys,  
I want to play Dota on my new ASUS laptop but the thing is whenever i press F1 to select my hero the sound gets muted, or F2 for courier the sound gets lower. When I hold ""fn"" key it is ok, but i can not play the game while pressing the fn key whole the time.

DotA2,Old Arcana,"It's been quite a while since various arcana skins were released.

As far as I know, the rest of the Arcana skins, except for the IO Arcana, are not exclusively provided.

Users and new users who missed the purchase due to circumstances do not even have the right to choose.

In order to satisfy various users, I think it would be nice to be able to choose between the new Arcana skin and the old Arcana skin when the conditions for the battle pass are met.

For example, when reaching level 500, whether to choose a new arcana or an arcana skin from the past, I would like the user to have the right to choose.

We believe that the opportunity afforded to everyone should be equal.

No promises, but I think the Dota 2 developers definitely need to give their opinions.

Or shatter everyone's dreams. We never plan to release it.

Then there will be people who give up cleanly.

I think there are always people waiting for a half-baked answer. Not only me, but someone else is waiting like that.

She doesnt add any info
She just says whatever
Her voice is annoying

We have a discord community for all ranks and mmrs that want to play inhouse 5v5 captain's mode and 5 man party queues. During the day we run party queues and during the weekends and some week nights we have organised inhouse games.
 
&amp;nbsp;

The 5 man party queues are a great way for everyone to play in a much more relaxed and chill setting, while the inhouses are a great way for people to learn drafting and deeper strategy.

&amp;nbsp;

This is a great place for new players to learn and find people who are friendly to teach them stuff about Dota. For the more seasoned players we have been running as many inhouse games as possible to engage in some more organised games that will require teamwork. It's also been really great to see new people joining and taking the initiative to organise their own groups to play with.

&amp;nbsp;

Discord invite link: https://discord.gg/qt7A3ZPvSG

&amp;nbsp;

Some things to consider:

- Our server is based in AU/SEA server, so most games will be played on these two servers.

- Entry to Discord requires some basic info to be posted in a verification channel such as preferred region and role, rank, behaviour score, the reason you want to join.

- Verification process won't take long, so it won't be much of a hassle.

&amp;nbsp;

Any other questions you can reply here or in Discord.

Thanks for considering and hope to see you there soon! (We have a few inhouses tonight which you can join as well.)",1652510934

DotA2,After a little less than 1400 hours of dota I played risk and realized something ...,"I spent most of my adult life playing dota. Recently I picked up a second job so my free time shrank by a lot

Being addicted to multiplayer games,I picked up a game that I could play both on my phone at job and on steam

Then I noticed something...

In risk , usually wins come after around 45 Minutes to an hour and you gotta struggle and do a lot of smart moves while in losses you are terminated from the game in less than 15 Minutes and you don't struggle that much because losses can be easily blamed on extremely shitty initial random placement or bad dice or suicide bombers (the players that don't care about winning and just throw them selves at you)

Dota is exactly the opposite ...
When winning, the game feels easier and shorter and even undeserved because usually the entire team is good and you can feel carried, while the losses are struggle and feel like an eternity. sure there is that one in 100 come back game  that feels good but it's extremely rare

I don't know what to do with this information I just thought it was interesting that I had to get out of the game to realize why it feels so unfulfilling",1652496864

I would like new radius to be 1200 or maybe 1400.  
I would like the duration to be 18 seconds

also make dust undispellable. Riki with manta or LC with press attack can very easily dodge the dust. Even sk with Eul is annoying. Did I mention bara with 65% status resistance? thats makes it currently last 4.2 seconds lol",1652489245

DotA2,ESL One Stockholm 2022 Day 3 Fantasy Guide,"Time for day 3.

**Day 2 overview**

Since the tracker doesn't actually have a filter for individual days, I can't accurately confirm which ones are the highest scoring of the day. But looking at the overall averages, the standout players of the day seem to Karl, M1cke, Gabbi, Matumbaman, bzm, Kuku,  whitemon, skem and Yatoro.

**Day 3 predictions**

Due to MG getting disqualified, all of their scheduled games are a default loss and won't be played, meaning no points for any of them. As such the playable teams for day 3 goes down from 10 to 7, only 2 from group B instead of the usual 5.

The 7 teams are EG, T1, Tundra, betboom, BOOM, TA and Liquid.

Top recommendations being the players of T1 and Liquid as their carry and mid players still at top of the averages. of their respective roles. Another team to consider is TA as DarkMago is the third highest scoring mid and PandaMoo is the highest scoring support so they're worth playing as well if you have them. Abed is worth playing if you insist on playing an EG card, the rest can be ignored. Kuku and Whitemon also have surprisingly high averages so it's likely they will continue as such so even an almost pure T1 lineup will score well. Other notable cards with good averages are skem and daxak and they both play vs T1 so expect them to score well tomorrow as well. 33 and skiter are barely playable as well.


**Day 3 recommended players**

Core: Gabbi=Matumbaman &gt; Kuku=Daxak=33 &gt; skiter

Mid: Karl &gt; m1cke &gt; DarkMago &gt; Abed &gt; yopaj

Support: PandaMoo &gt; Whitemon=skem &gt; Matthew=insania &gt; Boxi

I don’t even have to say anything, it all happens in the draft. I constantly lose gold and wait for supports to pick for them to pick a sniper or a nec as my hard support. Rotating doesn’t exist. All of it just hurts my brain and I don’t understand what i can do to be better beside paying for a boost to get me out of this god awful rank.

DotA2,Have fun mentality need to be cleared,"As far as i know, have fun mentality is the player having fun without disregarding other's fun.

You not mocking your teammates advice/command, you not throwing your rage at your teammates, you not stealing your core last hits, you are not being jerk is the most basic mindset.

I am sick of people saying""JUST HAVE FUN LOL"" like we are not trying to have fun. We are trying to have fun. We are not even say anything to this dumb mf until at last minute we kindly ask him what's with the blunder? And then he said, ""JUST HAVE FUN DONT BE SAD"". Its not my first time seeing this attitude. Need to be known, only in dota i can see this attitude everyday.

Its like have fun mentality overshadowed competitive mentality. You dont have to be super competitive and coach everyone's movement, at least mind other's fun and watch your attitude.",1652454915

DotA2,To ESL: Please don't end the game too soon,"The current situation is: When one team type gg, ESL ends the game right away in 1-2 sec, then loud music etc...

There are 2 drawbacks:

- Sometimes gg can be a mistake. Team can try to revert back.

- There is not enough time for audience to register the win. Because players usually type gg in the middle/at the end of a big team fight, audience needs sometime to read gg chat.

Suggestion: Keep the game going until throne blow up. It will be more satisfied.

Thank you.",1652453258

DotA2,Can we limit Replays to 10 Seconds? - Major feedback,"Im seriously baffled how everytime. And im not exaggerating. Everytime there is a replay we miss something in the live game.   
Dota is very deep, even when 9 people are dead there is stuff happening in the game. And still production decides to replay COMPLETE teamfights which often take 2 minutes or more.

It really isnt that important. I wanna see the game and not what happened 30 seconds ago. I like it when they show little moments. ""Carry x/y didnt get his bkb off after jump"" or ""watch what happened to puck after he jumped the backline"" But they always show the complete teamfight from start to finish and we ALWAYS miss something because of it. I hate it. Please make it stop.

And if I make even a minor mistake here or there, it just trashes my chance of winning.  And this is just in random unranked.

Do I still enjoy playing, sure, but it definitely limits me to a few games a day at best due to the pressure. Love it also when people ping my items after they die, as if what I built would have stopped them from getting caught out or them just having bad positioning in general.

Say I'm on enigma, I have to make sure to get efficient black holes, not just 3 man+.  Sometimes worth it just to force them to do something to you if you snag a core+support. But if I don't, you'll bet it that I'll hear it from my team.

I don't particularly remember it ever being this bad, but eh. Not sure if it's in part due to most people these days being better at the game, or what.",1652448604

My acc clear so that's not  HWID ban. I thin she was banned because of too much reports. But she received &lt; 3. We created another acc and started over. And on 15th game she got ban again but now FOREVER. How it's possible? She play very bad so ban couldn't be for boosting. If she was banned because of reports for bad game, it's stupid to give ban forever by reports. She was kicked from match and got this msg with 1 decency. I don't know what to do...

DotA2,EG and Storm - Why and why not?,"I understand that Bulba feels the hero is good and I understand that Abed can play Storm very well.

If teams were actually afraid of EG Storm, they would just straight out ban it. Just like they were banning Collapse Mars, Miracle- Invoker or Burning AM.

EG - Abed Storm has almost never received a respect ban. Why? Because teams have no problems against playing against it.

I'm not an EG fan. I love Cr1t because he is extremely good, I love Arteezy because of MLG finals vs DK but other than that, I don't really care about EG. I'm just baffled about this Storm picking...

**At this point, I think Bulba has a personal grudge against the whole community and he wants to show us that his drafts around Storm are actually good and that he is a good drafter.**

I've performed Ubuntu software update yesterday (via Software Updater) and since then Dota won't start - it quits unexpectedly after Dota logo appears (see video). What I tried so far:

\- both options: `-autoconfig` and `-safe`

\- verifying integrity of game files

\- reinstalling game

\- was looking for any signs of crash reports in `~/.steam/debian-installation/logs`

With no joy :(

DotA2,Struggling in unranked,"I love Dota 2 mechanically and all the visual designs and feel of it. Originally started playing back in 2012 and have been playing on/off ever since.  


But at the same time it's demoralizing to lose repeatedly and get flamed as a support despite keeping wards bought out, buying solely support items to try and keep my team alive for a few seconds longer instead of just vaporizing, and have top hero damage.  


I don't care about MMR, or being the ""best"", I just want to have fun with a few heroes I like visually and mechanically, and it's hard when most of my matches turn into people yelling or bigoted. Combining that with generalized anxiety and already struggling to do non-bot matches because of worrying about people getting mad, and it's exhausting. (Like, I have to hype myself up for 30-60 min just to queue for a game level of anxiety.)  


Anyone have some advice for how to still relax, or is it just expected to feel stressed out in unranked like it used to be in ranked now?",1652418516

DotA2,i have an idea to improve matchmaking and dota 2 experience.,"at the end of everymatch, you can request players to be added to your party pool, if they accept you are also added to their party pool.

then in the ranked match tab of main page, there will be a checkbox called ""party pool if possible"" or sth, if u check it, while queuing if any of your party pool friends are queuing too, they will be automatically added to your party and merge, without stopping queue, while checking if separate roles are selected.it might not work as your players may not be queuing that moment.

this way, you can add as many players as you like to your party pool and you will be paired with allies of your choice if possible. if the mmr difference gets higher than 600 the player will automatically removed from your pool.

the problem is that it will most likely only add one player to your party, because for the third player to be added, he need to be at each player's party pool which can be solved I'm sure experts find a way.

players will behave better to get more players in their pool, people can meet and find friends easier and eventually good players will be rewarded with more mmr because of having better allies.

you might argue that this might make games easier for low skill players to get mmr, but they can't just add anyone they like to their pool, cuz they need to be accepted meaning play good.",1652408980

DotA2,Dota Freezing when Alt-tabbed,"Hi all,

I just got a new laptop, because my old one kicked out. It is a significant upgrade in terms of performance (RTX 3080), even though my old laptop's RTX 2060 was running Dota2 completely fine with 100+ FPS before it died. 

I've noticed new issues with my lap top including, lag on the main menu (last match hero animations), which I already though was quite weird as I never had issues with that even on my older, worse performing laptop. I bit the bullet and just renamed the last match background so its just a black screen (as recommended on here).

My more recent issue now is that I'm freezing my dota2 when I alt tab it. I often alt tab and watch youtube or do work, while I'm waiting for queue, or waiting for the game to load. It doesn't happen all the time, but I recently picked up an abandon when I alt-tabbed out of the pick screen to do something.

I'm confused because I never had this issue on my old computer, with worse specs, worse GPU. I honestly expected running dota2 to be a piece of cake, when I picked up this new laptop. 

Anyone have any similar experiences, insight, solutions?

Thanks",1652407296

DotA2,ESL One Stockholm 2022 Day 2 Fantasy Guide,"Here again for Day 2's predictions. But an overview of Day 1.

**Day 1 Overview**

tl;dr Ideal lineup Yatoro Dyrachyo bzm dj PandaMoo

Despite only playing 1 series each (TA vs MG was forfeited by MG), both TA and Liquid actually scored really well thanks to their series being long and close. Matu ended up as the fourth highest core, only overtaken by Yatoro, dyrachyo and Daxak. DarkMago was the second highest scoring mid behind bzm and Micke was fourth behind Karl. PandaMoo was the second highest support, behind dj and Insania was third highest. It's very likely that these players will continue to score well over the tournament

NA teams were terrible as expected. TSM has Bryle playing offlane which means his card isn't gonna be scoring well and Saberlight is sick so they have CCnC playing mid(who won't count towards anyone for points) and their performance is just horrible to the point where it isn't worth playing any of the rest. EG were just horrible over all and unless the performance gets better later on, you can instantly ignore both of these teams for future days' fantasy.

The surprise factor was Thunder Awaken. DarkMago and PandaMoo scored very well and will definitely be considered for future fantasy teams. beastcoast was just terrible as expected. Liquid was amazing and Matu, Micke and Insania will all be valuable picks as they have been for the EU dpc fantasy. It remains to be seen if the Liquid TA series will be a one-time thing or if they'll continue to produce results but I'm confident in both teams now after watching the games.


**Day 2 Predictions**

Playable teams with 2 series are OG, T1, Tundra, BOOM, bc, Liquid, Spirit, GG, TSM, MG. 

Out of these I will completely ignore all TSM, MG and bc players. MG is playing with 2 subs and TSM with 1 and the remaining players + beastcoast players don't score well. Wisper did well today but he's an offlaner and not stable so not gonna rely on any of those players, only option worth considering is stinger from beastcoast and dubu from tsm.

Notable players from the remaining teams worth playing are Yuragi, bzm, skiter, dyrachyo, tofu, boom, gabbi, karl, whitemon, skem, yopaj, Yatoro, TorontoTokyo, Matumbaman, Micke and Insania.

Note that since T1's only series was a stomp, it deflated whitemon's points and inflated kuku's and I don't expect this to continue at least in the series vs OG, which is why Kuku is not mentioned but whitemon is. If you expect otherwise feel free to swap those around as you feel.


**Players for each role**

Core: Matumbaman=Dyrachyo=skiter &gt; Yatoro=Yuragi=Gabbi

Mid: bzm=Karl &gt; m1cke &gt; BOOM=TorontoTokyo=Yopaj &gt; Nine

Back in 2020 at the start of the pandemic queing ranked solos while off work, I stacked up with a Chen that would later become one of my best buds and his crew from California. Myggs (the chen player) invited me to join their stack and shortly after, the newly formed TI READY Guild(TIRDY) /readysetthrow discord. I didn't know it yet, but that was the start of a lifelong friendship with some amazing guys. Throughout the last 2 years, we have actively been playing Dota together (over 3-4k) almost every night and the guild has grown to over 20+ regularly active players, along with a sister guild we do inhouses/stacks with. The community we have made is one we pride ourselves in, helping new players learn the game and casual players improve while still having fun. Like anything, we aren't perfect, but we actively try to encourage others to enjoy the game that brought all of us together. Trying to show people why we fell in love with Dota and the friendships we were able to create along the way. I know it sounds cheesy, but the community and guild has made me excited to hop onto Dota every/other night. 

Fast forward 2 years to 2022, we decided to do a group trip to meet each other in Las Vegas, finally putting a face to the voices we play. I wanted to share our team/discord video of some of the footage we grabbed while we were in Vegas and encourage anyone who needs a homie to come hang out. I know these guys were there for me when I needed them, and visa versa, and we'd love to open the community to more Dota lovers and memers. We also have started to play more Overwatch if y'all are every interested in watching, every Tuesday.

* I have made a [DPC Fantasy Tracker](https://virendias.github.io/dpc-fantasy/) to help you guys evaluate your results.
* The data I have used to make this post is available in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc).

# Data Sources

* The numbers are based on each player's 25 most recent tier 1 and 2 pro matches.
* The data has been acquired from OpenDota and datdota.

#  General Strategy

* **Favour players from teams that will play more series.** Although only the highest-scoring series is counted, players playing more series are more likely to have a better score.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to win their matches.** Core and Mid players score 30–50% more in winning games, and Support players score 10–20% more in winning games.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to play longer matches.**
* **Favour carry players for the Core slots.** This should be the case 99% of the time. Carry players score just as much in losses, as offlane players score in wins.
* **Favour hard support players for the Support slots.** This primarily hinges on which support places the most observer wards for the team, which may not always be the hard support.

# Gold/Silver Card Bonuses

2. Match Performance in interntional majors, tournaments &amp; TIs   
3. Player Performance   
4. Team Synergy &amp; Performance   
5. Is the team currently in Meta   
6. Any other X factors

DotA2,Put some respect on Fly's &amp; S4's name,"I feel like it's appropriate since this is the first time we see EG on LAN without Fly or S4 since they have joined in 2018.

They took a dysfunctional EG to third place in TI8 shortly after joining, finished a lacking but respectable 5-6th at TI9 and Fly reached multiple grand finals at Majors with them even after roster shuffles.

The core of RTZ+cr1t+Bulba has been the one constant in all these lineups, and we've seen how they're doing today.

I feel like giving a shoutout to Fly whose part in OG's accomplishments when he was on the roster and his quality as a player have been constantly put into question (to put it mildly) ever since he left OG and to this day, and S4 who people kept calling washed and unfit for the off-lane.",1652369939

in T1 vs EG game 2 EG had much much much better draft and they still lost.

btw storm is strong midlaner . when I compare bzm's performance with storm definitely the hero or pick isn't problem.

DotA2,Would it be too strong to give Monkey King's aghs shard magic immunity during mischief (without a dispel)? Note that you can always just attack MK once any time to break mischief instantly and remove the magic immunity,"It's no secret that MK shard is in bad shape, 0 purchases out of hundred plus games at DPC and I've never ever seen a high MMR MK player buy this shard unless they already won the game.

Was wondering if, on top of what the shard already gives, it might be make the shard viable if it gave Monkey King magic immunity during mischief. The magic immunity wouldn't come with any dispel (just like Lion's aghanim's shard magic immunity) so any damage over time on Monkey King will just continue after mischief ends and will not be dispelled.

Don't think it would be that overpowered or anything because any hero can hit Monkey King once to break his mischief, and Monkey King cannot attack or cast anything during mischief. 

Thoughts? I hope they don't give up on trying to make mischief more viable, it's such a cool ability.",1652360674

3. A second aghanim's shard available at 30 minutes with more power
4. New map objectives

DotA2,Everyting That Could Reduce Smurfing [ Serious Discussion Only],"Part1 = Selfish Reason Why I Smurf a bit, and also why i think people smurf and illusionary percentages of smurf categories

Part2= Ideas, feel free to add your own to chat, most of ideas are simple and if implemented in mass, would have significant effects, even reducing broken games by 25-30% is massive considering how many low quality games there are.

**PART1**

There are few factors that force me to smurf;1- There are no ranked roles above 7.5k, i have incredibly inconsistent performance accross roles, where it matters at that rank due to hero pool of players

2- My friends wants to play, they give their second accounts even, but they dont want to play unranked. Specifically if stack is not 5, which is kinda reasonable, as people want highest quality game,(Oh and free mmr from a smurf! )

3- Specifically if playing a new complex hero ( my hero pool consists of riki and pangolier in offlane) i get automatic 3-4 reports and lose behaviour score, even if i keep 50% winrate through decision making, me spearing the air  as mars makes people report me instantly, or going 0\\5\\3 in first 10 minutes of the game, Dota is already an overwhelming game, specifically in first few games of a hero it is impossible to not completely ruin the game at that rank .It is terrible when i play something hard to play, One guy was calling me by my score whole game while updating it as i progress, Mr 0\\5\\3, 1\\5\\3,    1\\6\\4 ,  it sounds fun that is why i wanted to share it, even though it was not when it happened

4- I dont do it but some players wants to play with their penis while ( notto be sexist, i am not claiming women dont smurf, people offend them for being women enough i dont have to.)

I have around 2-3% of my games as smurf , but to categorize smurfs through illusionary data in my head i would say;

**CATEGORIES**

1- 40% are booster acc sellers on new accounts, they purchase low mmr calibrated account for \`10-20 Dollars, boost to 5-6k and sell for 50-200 dollars ( 8.5k account goes for 1000)

2- 30% are psychopaths that would love to go to a kindergarden as an adult and compete with 6 years old kids and somehow would be satistified with it,  while flaming the kids.

3- 20% are people on their second accounts, no one complain about them, i would predict they are the ones flame people for being bad, while themselves play bad on their smurf .

4-10% have simply normal dota2 horribly unenjoyable due to problems mostly with dota2 with various reasons, Lack of ability to be anonymous, lack of rankes roles or humane matchmaking ( all games are dogshit quality past 7.5k mmr , people there who dontlose mind are extremely mentally strong people even gorgc, imagine a maniac who play the worst matchmaking all day while reading twitch chat, EVERY SINGLE DAY of his life) Peopel hold grudges, for example i am turkish and there was a turkish doctor who is actually also past 7.5k that was sending me death threats. He was griefing me , not rolling for offlane ETC, i have grudge againist him, put him on my team and i will just also 2nd pic kofflane // insta pick. In fact imagine a horrible pool whre you got 1500 people in europe where all players roughly have an idea of who everyone else is.  It is just so terrible.  You got bad matchmaking, no anonymity causing all sort of problems, Game is hard and going out of comfort zone to learn is impossible, unranked queue time is always minimum 10 minutes, after which i think game dumps conditions rapidly and so on;

**PART2**

1- Rapid Temporary Ranked Bans for High probability SMURFS and Account Buyers

Eloboration;  Statistically Speaking, you may need to observe someone for 50 games to be 99.9%+ confidert about fact that they are speaking, however with data of person's settings changes, performance data , clicks per min  data and god knows what other easy to process data valve have,  only 15 games may be enough for 95% prediction if someone is cheating or not, Valve as far as i know does not make use of aggresive punishments, We all know why and it is completely a legit concern they have, but through reduction of impact of unstable players on Dota2's enviroment, instead of having 5000 games griefed, we can have only 1500 games griefed, which is a massive difference, valve needs to relook into their punishment system, by the time they react damage is already being done. This banned player just wont be able to play ranked, or perhaps if very dangerous one, have game limitations.

WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT; When a booster is destroying game with 95% accuarcy, remember guys if he makes it to selling the account, for each game he have ruined, another guy will ruin another game, eliminating them is like double impact.

2- Following very short changes to unranked;  Rapid Queue ; Teams are balanced equally based on hidden mmr, no balancing or minor balancing on MMR Gap,,Role queue is added since previous change should greatly increase amount of games meaning you can play with vastly lower mmr players or highest mmr ones as long as teams are approximately equal as side note; It might be good to keep it simple and set mmr gap based on simply if there are new players or not.

Why suggest this? 4k, top 15% percentile psychopath ancient 3 GOD will get to enjoy even if he loses game, by performing good and being satistified with how good he is  , atleast feel better than normal and blame non-existant forced 50% over actually going to a smurf account, High mmr guy wont go to his smurf account to play 5 games of lycan because he did not play lycan for 3 years, We wil lhave a proper casual queue , imagine a totally optional casual queue, this is ued in games like world of tanks and escape from tarkov, you are a god in escape from tarkov? yo uare always a god, except you are maybe 5% god or 0.1% god, in dota2 ur an idiot for being 0.01% in ranked roles because 0.005% guy did not like your performance. This will greatly reduce egoistical smurfs longterm, It will surely make unranked worse for some people, But amount of unranked games is incredibly low in dota2, the queue is kinda dead, while i understand this will upset 5% of people it should greatly help to other 95% And also it may not even upset them, i calibrated at 1.8k, before grinding to 8k, i would always prefer to play in an enviroment where there are more skilled players . Imagine being 4k and getting to play a game that has average 2k or average 6k, i think having this casual queue option is actually a very beatiful thing. NOTE: this change would not have immediate impact till people switch out of old methods slowly.  


3- We got one way  anonymity  where we dont see other people, give us two way  anonymity , where other people can't see our steam profile, name etc, instead replaced with i dont know somethnig casual and fun like rylai's sister . 

Thank you for not reading, or reading everything , if you got simple, easy to execute ideas feel free to discuss them and write them. Clearly JUST BAN MORe or BETTeR DeTECTion Gaben PLSX not working and something different has to be done, i believe a casual rapid queue and improved soft ban techniques that are applied early would greatly change the game",1652311264

DotA2,Moment of Courage is broken,"Unless this is supposed to be a MASSIVE hidden nerf to an already trash hero, Legion Commander passive is not working properly right now. I am not sure when this got changed but it happened sometime in the last couple of days. Whenever Legion gets attacked she is supposed to have a chance to get a moment of courage proc for a second or until you attack an enemy. Right now the ability does not proc if you are not actively attacking an enemy unit. This means that if you stand in a creep wave and tank the entire wave but issue no attack commands you will never proc moment of courage. This is A MASSIVE nerf as she can no longer use moment of courage to deny creeps AND makes the spell low key useless in lane. 75% of the time nobody wants to man fight legion in lane so they run away. Previously you could get moment procs off the creeps and use them on the hero running away. Now this is incredibly inconsistent to downright impossible because you only proc if you are already in your attack animation, which means your not moving. Playing the lane is also way worse because you HAVE to push the wave and take damage to get procs. Please valve fix this bug or give Legion back the 75 base damage on e because she feels horrible currently.",1652306953

DotA2,Top 10 Worst Aghs in Dota 2,"With Bloodseeker Aghs rework I wanted to list out the worst aghs currently in the game and explain why in hopes Valve will consider some reworks

In no particular order....

**Top 10 Worst Aghs**

1. **WindRanger Aghs -** Hopefully this is a place holder. This aghs turned into a must have into a dead last choice. Essentially Windrun into a movement based Blinding light, it also makes it so you cant dispel Windrun. Support WR is the only role that would consider getting this, and in this case most carry's will have mkb by this time
2. **Dazzle's New Aghs** \- Turned a hero with a unique mechanism with multiple roles into a glorified support with a ITEM refresher stone that can be cast on allies. This aghs makes absolute no sense to me in the current power creep meta, where heroes can play multiple roles, this further solidified Dazzle into a hard support.
3. **Drow Aghs** \- The aghs here is intended to help turn drow into the ultimate illusion killer/hg holder. In reality, this aghs has strange interactions with items/modifiers and is basically a more expensive version of the shard (which has a similar result for way cheaper)
4. **Tiny Aghs** \- This aghs would be incredibly strong, but the basis of needing trees makes it incredibly awkard and situational. 
5. **Lesh Aghs** \- This may be controversial, but old aghs on lesh was leaps and bounds better. Nihilism, essentially is an aoe Ghost Shroud. You'll notice at all levels this aghs is a rare pick-up. As a lesh spammer, this aghs a magic hero this sounds insanely strong, however:
   1. The mana cost of this feels high, when considering the rest of the costs of spells.
   2. It has awkward interactions with bkb
   3. Many items lesh would get with this build are completely countered with nullifier
   4. It has a long CD with a short uptime.
   5. Pugna's shard allows Pugna to do this to illusions in a much more meaningful way with a low CD ult from a distance.
6. **Marci's Agh**s - With Marci shifting more towards a support, this feels quite awkward and should be reworked or turned into the shard (Look at Undying's Aghs)
7. **Mirana Aghs** \- Anytime someone gets this, it feels like a joke. You spend 4.2k gold on a skillshot to potentially do a little more damage. What a joke.
8. **Legion Commander Aghs** \- This aghs used to be so strong, as it gave spell immunity. With all of the changes over the years this aghs was aligned to the old LC and needs an iteration. Compare this aghs to Huskar Aghs....
9. **Witch Doctor Aghs**\- For some reason the basic of this ult does not have true strike (quite silly imo as you can dodge it with ghost scepter/invis/euls anyways) this aghs feels like it should be worked into the basics of the hero.
10. **Mars Aghs** \- This came about after SiltBreaker or the first Aghs Lab. Most though it was a joke, and it still is. This should be completely reworked.

Honorble Mentions

1. **Lifestealer Aghs** \- Unsure if this aghs is bad or not right now, seems like a meme build and should be iterated on.
2. **Primal Beast Aghs** \- Obvious, but no aghs here, all heroes should be released with an aghs buff moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aghs that are not bad, but have a terrible design...**

I find aghs that just give a hero a charge count  increase to be incredibly bad design,

**Ult Charges:** 

Brewmaster Aghs - Literally just adds another ult for Brew - Once a hero gets this + aeon disk they are impossible to kill without getting a wealth of items, if they get refresher, good luck ever killing them.

Clock Aghs - Basically the same aghs as Brew - just refreshes their ult, in clock's stance it makes him do a bunch of  coke and then crash hard after as a mini balance. This seems quite silly and lazy.

SD Aghs -  I know its on an SD but this aghs can be incredibly strong and again does not favor any sort of spell strategy, can't dodge it.

There are quite a few other aghs that grant charges to existing spells, for the most part I felt they added to the heroes kit. However an argument could be made to rework, Dark Seer, Ember's,  and ODs,   


**Aghs that are impossible to Dodge**

**Tusk** **Aghs -** Literally cant dodge the kick with anything, and you can kick from snowball, how is this balanced.

**Huskar Aghs**  \- Incredibly hard to dodge, need linkens, for some reason you can't dodge Huskar in air as the aghs creates an invisible projectile that taunts you, only can dodge the taunt with linkens.",1652297752

I also wish the players who are getting interviewed would give more insight and better answers than they did in the DPC.

'What were your thoughts when you were behind'

'How does it feel to play with X player'

'Can you tell us what the comms where at X moment?'

DotA2,"IceFrog, please give Bad juju its item CDR back.","Dazzle is my second most-spammed hero and one of my favorite supports to first-phase, and the changes to bad Juju in 7.31 have really adversely affected the core of what makes post-weave Dazzle fun. It's clear the frog was tryin to add more interesting synergy to his kit by giving grave heal amp, a heal on end talent, a new shard, and an ultimate that modifies armor differently. But the Bad Juju change has really changed the hero for the worse in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

i've heard takes from a lot of professional players like Topson that the new ultimate has 'killed the hero', and I think that's exaggerating a bit much. The ability CDR is still substantial, though not as insane, and its clear that Dazzle is being tooled towards the 'spam the fuck out of all your spells' side of things. I think his winrate in all brackets shows the hero is still viable, and I have something near a 75% wr on him in 7.31. That being said, I think people are right to say that the new ult feels underwhelming. Without octarine, you simply cannot build enough stacks of Bad Juju for the active to be much other than a button to reduce your other abilities by 2 seconds, and it isn't spammable with such a long cooldown. 

&amp;#x200B;

He also suffers heavily from mana issues due to his spammy nature, even with an extremely high mana regen talent, and an item build that allows you to constantly build and dissassemble arcs. Sadly, locking the item cdr component of his kit behind the aghs really handicaps his spell-spam, and removes one of his more powerful pieces of lategame kit by replacing his dispel and amplified heal with an ex machina that you *could* use on teammates, if it didn't suffer from a cripplingly short 250 cast range when compared to all his other abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

Locking his item CDR behind a 4200 gold item also nullifies a lot of the items that make dazzle and other defensive supports so good. force staff, glimmer, lotus, mekansm, greaves (*which was previously his best buildup),* and even locket to an extent became much less effective, to the point where it is a lot more gold-efficient on new dazzle to simply rush a value locket for the heal amp and go straight for shard aether lens octarine, items with no active component just to selfishly supplement your own kit instead of helping your allies. Defensive items used to be the core of dazzles kit, because he is a **defensive support,** but with the new changes this is no longer the case. Buying defensive items, you have the same cooldowns as every other hero in dota, and even if you buy them, its often better  to simply get octarine after instead of aghs for the smaller overall CDR, but the much larger effect of allowing you to spam spells more and utilize good juju more often.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, you either get aghs early and have no cooldowns to reduce because it's only good for self-casting, or never get it at all because once you have other items to reduce, octarine is better and the game is already over. Pls fix.",1652282418
DotA2,Should the Role Queue be slow again?,"Hello guys,

this problem exists for a long time now, but i unfortunatly see it more frequently nowadays. People who queue for all roles to stock up their games but dont play pos 4/5 when they get it. To often i see useless sups in lanes that practically stay afk for 5 minutes until the carry gives up the lane and goes jungling. Usually you see that they only buy observer wards and sentry wards are at their 10/10 limit. The amount of core heroes ive seen on pos5 are not normal.

The solution in my opinion is, that we extend the queue times by erasing the counter. A Carry/Mid queue would be longer then, but i would love to queue for 15 minutes and have a good game without griefing pos 4/5. 

What is your opinion on that topic? Also sorry for the bad english, not so fluent anymore after a few years..

DotA2,Smurfs tanking their MMR in Japan/SEA servers.,"Hey guys, me and my friend group play dota games after work and on the weekends so we normally don't get to spam too many games (we play on Japan and SEA servers). However recently we've been running into teams where the players have 90%+ winrates and winstreaks in the 100s. Looking on the dotabuffs of the players (that aren't anonymous) they also have heroes with a &lt;10% win rate, so we think they intentionally lose on some heroes to lower MMR and then stomp lower-skilled players to keep their insane winstreaks. For reference, check out this game https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/6564809014.

The Ursa's profile is anonymous but on the dota client it told us he had a 378 winstreak on Ursa alone. 

My ultimate question is, is this bannable? We reported them for match-fixing abuse but this is the second time we've run into this exact group (there are other groups we've faced that do this too). If not, is there anything we can do about it? Next time we run into them we will try our hardest to win, but a 378 win streak is a bit disheartening.",1652278864

DotA2,"When spend more energy of checking profiles at the start of the games rather than spend energy to focus and get mentally ready for the game. This makes us play worse than we normally would. Most of the time, it's us who defeat ourselves even before the game starts, not the smurf.","It was the year 2004. I was playing Warcraft III:TFT 1v1 Ladder.

In Warcraft III, you could type : ""/stats XXX"", and the game would show you your opponents stats.

In Warcraft III there were a lot of smurfs who created accounts to hide their identity when they would practice for tournaments.

If you had many games played, the system would often match you with these smurfs when they had around 7-8 wins and 0 losses.

**Checking enemy stats in Warcraft III made you anxious and it made you play worse.**

One day, after I came home from school, I sat down to play some 1v1's.

It was the map Lost Temple, my favourite map. I was playing Night Elf, and the enemy was Orc. It was my strongest matchup on my favourite map.

At the start of the match, my mother came into my room, said some stuff to me, and I didn't check the stats of my enemy.

The game went on. My opponent was good, but I was a decent player myself. I was chill, I focused and played my best and I won. I have to admit, I was on fire, I really played good that game. It was far above my average.

A few days after, something got to me and I checked the stats of my previous opponent. As it turned out later, he was MYM\]Ciara, a very established player back in the day.

**If I had checked his stats prior, I would have known that he is a smurf and that he is probably a semi-pro player and I would play like shit because I would have been afraid. I never would have won that game.**

You gain nothing from checking profiles. Literally nothing. Please, don't make yourself play worse for no reason. Play your best heroes, play your best roles, buy the correct items, don't get tilted, focus, don't lose hope.

If you lose, take the loss with dignity. Swallow your pride. Type ""gg gl next"" and accept that you could have probably played a little bit better.

If you got stomped, well shit happens. MUFC finished TI groupstages 0-12 and they went on.

DotA2,Would MMR reset seasonally reduce matchmaking abuse?,"It feels to me that alot of problems with match making could be resolved with seasonal forced MMR resets (maybe once a year).

Account buyers looking forward to ""prove"" themselves can look forward to proving themselves in the new season.

Smurfs won't have to play unranked until they can climb ladder again.

High MMR immortal players won't have time to play on so many accounts and competition between these players won't be a massive 3k MMR difference that only seems to grow larger over time.

I'm not sure of what the issues are with MMR resets, and why they work and don't work between different competitive games. I feel like there must be some balance between seasonal resets and the ability to reset individually mid season that's better for Dota than what we currently have. 

The only smurfs I don't see this kind of change having an impact on are: 1. Smurfing to play with friends, 2. Smurfing for an anonymous identities (the original reasoning). 3. The physcopaths that do it inorder to feel the only sense of accomplishment available in there lives. 

But reducing the overall number of reasons and promoting of smurfs should encourage less people to do it.

Whenever he plays core, he would complain about shitty supports and then decides to play away from the team cause team fucking sucks and he got no trust in them. Proceeds to play in unwarded parts of the map alone and dies. I asked him, why don't u buy wards? 

 ""but I'm carry, the supports are not doing their job warding"" 

""but you walked into unwarded parts of the map? And all enemies are not showing? Also, wards are free, you know?"" 

When he decides to play support, suddenly his carry sucks and he's forced to play as a core and decides to afk farm core items because he doesn't trust his team to carry him.

"" I'm not warding for this guy he can go fk himself""

Me ""maybe you should try single player game"" 

Additional: whenever he wants to do something, he doesn't communicate with team. Gets angry when team doesn't do what he wants, starts using voice chat to flame them. 

I said ""you should communicate with your team, you're not communicating"" 

""It's basic! Everyone knows you should stun (hero name) first! Why am I playing with these kind of players! I don't deserve to be in this rank! "" 

""uhh.. Cause your skill levels are similar? Honestly tho, if you'd just start communicating what you want to do you're probably going to get at least 2 - 3 rank higher like slacks. If you'd stop flaming your team at the slightest inconvenience you're probably another 2 rank higher""

There is something I haven't told you about John. I'm not sure why have I left it out before. This event was the trigger that forced John to change his attitude and how he looks at the game.

The events that you are about to read, happened long before John met Yatoro.

It was a typical day in John's life. The night before when he went to bed, he promised himself that next day he will be productive and that the first the he will do in the morning is to sit down and study for a few hours and clean his room. He promised himself that he won't play Dota the next day. It's no surprise that the first thing he actually did in the morning was a nice game of Dota. The best thing you can do to wake up and kickstart your day is a game of Dota, right? Turns out it wasn't.

Please note that there was no rolequeue when this happened. John started Dota, clicked the Find Match button and the clock started ticking.

Even before the game started, he knew he was going to play Sven. He was in the mood for Sven. He wanted to AFK farm and oneshot people with a crit. His life was dominating him. So he wanted to dominate others. He didn't care about a good team composition or natural pick orders with supports picking first. He wanted to pick carry and play Sven. There is forced 50% winrate anyway, he thought. So why not?

While the system was searching for a game, he was scrolling trough Facebook and Instagram, looking at pictures of hot girls that he can't have. They were mostly from his old high school, and they were hot as hell, living the glamorous Instagram life. Well, he could at least masturbate to the new scene with Danny D and Aletta Ocean and their Overwatch cosplay. As he was getting ready, the annoying super loud ""Match Found"" sound has popped up and he clicked accept. Aletta can wait. Sven can't.

Games before role queue were stressing even before the game started. You could never be sure that you can play the role that you liked. He made sure that he gets to play Sven by firstpicking him and refusing to roll for the carry role. After he firstpicked Sven, he obviously told his teammates what they should pick. John didn't care that the hard support guy is not in the mood for Crystal Maiden. John ordered him to pick Crystal Maiden.

Then something very strange happened. The Hard Support player has indeed picked Crystal Maiden, but there was something very unsettling about her voice. It was a disturbed voice of an older woman, with damaged vocal cords. He told John, that the time has come for his punishment. **In Exactly 1000 days, he will be cursed with physically painful, brain lobotomizing dreams every single night, for his every mistake that he didn't accept or when he blamed others**. Crystal Maiden didn't speak a single word after.

The game basically ended faster than it has started. John didn't buy a BKB on Sven, he didn't land a single autoattack in his ultimate. He played against 3 stuns and 2 slows. He farmed for 30 minutes, died without buyback and the enemy ended the game.

As the game ended, he remembered the old woman's voice. He laughed it off. It was surely some voice modifying software. Has to be. Right? Well, no. As it turned, the curse was real a real nightmare, just like a Hard Support Pudge that misses every single hook and blames you for not carrying the game.

1000 days have passed and the dreams have started.

It was very simple. As John fell asleep, he felt paralyzed. He was sleeping, but it felt like he is awake. He was conscious. In his dream, he was completely tied to a chair and couldn't move an inch. He was barefoot, and barehanded. He could speak and he could see. Oh how he wished he couldn't. The room was dark, all he could see was a big TV screen with Dota main menu. And his profile logged in. He was surprised that someone could log-in on his account in a random place. He was scared for his Dota inventory. As it turned out, it should have been the least of his concerns. He wasn't uncomfortable. The chair he was sitting in seemed comfortable. It was a brand new Secret Lab chair. But he was bored, and scared. He was sitting there for about twenty minutes, when he heard some sickly coughing. He couldn't see that part of the room, it was dark and there was no particular smell. He could have guessed that it's a human being by the cough and the sound of breathing.

Hello John. I'm here to fulfill the curse. Said the dark figure with a sickly, damaged voice.

John recognized the sound of the vocal cords.

It was the Crystal Maiden player that supposedly used some sound altering software. Except there was no software. It was the old hag. The curse was real. He was dreaming awake. He felt every sensation in his body. And the worse was about to come.

The hag didn't speak too much. She grabbed a mouse, it was a Zowie EC1. It was stained with grease, and the logo was half scratched off from all the usage. She found a game that John has lost and proceeded to download the replay.

The curse was simple.

She forced John to watch the game from his own perspective and whenever big mistakes came up, she slowed the replay to 0,5x speed so John can see it very well, so John can face his own failure.

John was playing Anti Mage and he was in his jungle. The enemy smoked, but one of the opponents killed John's observer ward, so it was obvious. But John kept farming. He got ganked and said : ""Omg, shit supports. No ward. Get cancer piece of shit""

The hag played the scene over and over on 0,5x speed. John was forced to look. Everytime the scene ended and John message popped up, the hag tried to cut of one of John fingers on his legs. It was really hard to cut, because the knife was dull and rusty. So sometimes the hag would just smash John's fingers with the hilt of the knife, then she would try to cut it again. Then she played the Antimage scene again, John watched and she was mutilating him. He was in immeasurable pain. He was crying, screaming, drooling from his mouth like a little piece of shit he is. A typical toxic blaming piece of shit.

When he watched the scene 10 times and he lost all of his fingers, the dream ended for that night and he woke up. He was nauseous, he puked many times, could barely walk, he had his fingers but he was afraid to look down. The only thing he could do to forget was what he always does when he tries to escape form reality. Dota.

It was strange. His teammate missed a spell, he was about to press enter to open chat, but his finger started hurting. He stopped. He swallowed his saliva and kept on playing.

He couldn't escape from the night. As he fell asleep, the terror once again started. He was watching different scenes all over and over. Destroying his own items because his pos5 Kotl killed a creepweave, him playing Lion in some other game when he used Finger for killsteal only so that he missed mana 15 seconds after when they could kill a core with it. Missing lasthits all around, dying outside of base without buybacks.

Whenever his chat messages popped up, the hag took some fingers. Sometimes she would get bored and puncture his fingers under the nails with a sharp object, or would cut parts of his tongue and feed him. The hag loved John's chat messages.

There was one way to end the terror, and it was saying the following words.

""There is no MMR hell. There is no forced winrate. My account is not cursed and it's not in some sorf of a shadow pool. If any top MMR player took my account, they would boost it up in no time. I am where I belong. I shouldn't flame people on my rank because I have played this game for 5000 hours and I'm still on their rank. It's not because of them. w33ha wouldn't care. w33ha got to top1 leaderboards by randoming heroes. W33ha can carry a bad team. If I want to get MMR I need to play better.""

After some nights, the terror has stopped. There was no dream. There were no nightmares.

When he lost the following Dota game, his first reflex was to flame. But then he remembered. He has made at least 50 mistakes that game, if not more. Had he made less mistakes, he surely would have won. He has to make less mistakes. It is how he will grow as a player. Not by blaming others.

You know the rest of the story. John is now a 6000 player, he still has space to improve. He knows he makes mistakes. He doesn't flame anyone, because he knows that he could also be flamed.

The legend says that the hag still terrorizes miserable pieces of shit that blame others for their long-term MMR.

Don't flame in your next game. We are all humans, we try our best. Even Messi misses penalties, even Warren Buffet has losing trades. If our teammate has destroyed his items, it means he needs mental help and probably has a very disturbed life. Don't feel angry about him, rather feel sorry for him and offer him your help and forgiveness. And don't forget, you MMR is the most precise representative of your skill level. If you deserve more than 3000, then you should be able to comfortably beat 3000 MMR players. If you think your team is holding you back, give your account to Yatoro. He could win with carry Crystal Maiden in 3000 MMR if he wanted to. A tilted teammate that destroyed items in one game, or an intentional feeder in the other is not the reason you are not satisfied with your long-term MMR.

DotA2,Do i need to play unranked until it stable gets divine/immortal GAMERS before ranked?,"Hello, misters, i am support played and i am not really experienced about new accounts;

Just out of fun experimental purposes i created new account and played 90 hours on this: [https://www.dotabuff.com/players/1285520921](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/1285520921)

First month i was memeing with unusual roles/heroes for me (antimage/britstle and stuff, lost many games); This month switched to my primary role and only winning so far;

I eventually get from 3 to 6 immortals in the game, but in average i get crusader-ancient players; And players with \~48-50% winrate;

Those average games i win easily, because my support competitors in the enemy team are nearly always very weak;

But when it gets to very high skill games, it is often a lose, because for some reason exactly my midlaner/carry just randomly gets disconnected for 4 minutes long at start, or my lastpick carry goes necrolyte jungle, so we have to do big weird lane/role transitions to barely fill the gaps;

I won some of these games, but average is still High/Normal skill;

Worth to mention i play at some weird late night/early morning timings with 10-30minutes queue times;

So, the question goes to those who are having more experience with new accounts: is my average skill  level related to lack of players during my gameplay time window, or it is because of my meme playing in the first month? What could i do to ensure my first calibration game will be at least low-medium divine?

Not like i am seeking for big numbers in the leaderboard, but just having fun with the calibration system i have never tried normally; Playing since 2007, but until December 2020 it was only Dota1 gameplay;

And i am not seeking for advices like 'try not to cheat the matchmaking system' - i do not care that much about Dota2, just experimenting and would like to see how much it gives from clean account's gameplay; *I wish it would not count those first meme games though*",1652246635

Radiance = buffed but still ass

Nullifier = very situational and just a luxury buy, but still works depending on opponent

DR = been ass ever since true strike was removed, but effective with some heroes

&amp;#x200B;

Suggestion: make the additional damage deal PURE damage and rework its upgrades

&amp;#x200B;

Radiance = +60 pure dmg, + status resist, + evasion, burn

Nullifier = debuff, +80 pure dmg

DR = +350 pure dmg

I believe this totally justifies the cost, especially with how the meta is leaning towards a faster game. This also brings back some of the ignored cores as well (Spec, Alch)",1652230143

In efforts to increase Bloodseeker's relevance, his Aghanim's Scepter ability was adjusted with the intention to bring more survivability to the hero.

This statement is half true. While Bloodseeker can now reduce his own damage by increasing his magic resistance, so can his enemies.

*Processing video mhuofbx8qqy81...*

**Bonus:** Now that Blood Mist is Magical damage and does not pierce spell immunity (enemies), the self-damage should be 0 during BKB similar to Rot. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

DotA2,Dota Chronicles - 1st Book - Invoker vs Antimage,"Hello dears,

&amp;#x200B;

After several years of intense work and non-stop writing, I am glad to announce that I have finally released the first book of my Ebook-Fan-fiction-Series: Dota Chronicles

The first book tells the story of Invoker and Antimage, crossing paths in a compelling intricated story that will answer many questions regarding the origins of our heroes, and that should entertain the readers and ignite their imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

Fascinating battles, breathtaking scenes, and twists will never be lacking in the fantasy world of Dota Chronicles.

DotA2,How does one attempt to get back into the game?,"I used to play the game religiously back in the days, between 2012-2016ish, eventually quit because the amount of competitive pro player strats that were expected of me became too stressful for me. But lately I've been getting this itch to play Dota again

I did try to play several months ago. Unsurprisingly the amount of pop-up messages from the past years really blew out my ears when I logged back it, it was unpleasant to say the least. I played Treant because it was an easy hero and played in Turbo because a friend told me it was ""easier"". Godamn it was more stressful than regular Dota because it's just so fast and everything happening faster than you can digest them

So how in the hell could I hope to possibly get back into casual Dota without having to spend weeks playing bot matches? What is even the current state of the game? It's so weird to me that now jungle creeps have their own item pool and whatnot. I cannot even fathom how in the hell a NEW PLAYER attempts to learn the game, who doesn't already have a basic understanding of the game",1652226802

DotA2,This game has become depressing over the years.,"Hate to sound whiny, but I'm just at a loss. Played since WC3 bnet days, did Heroes of Newearth, and swapped to DotA 2 when it came out. Don't have any friends that play the game so I can only play with randoms in ranked. After years and thousands of games win rate is still 50%, feels like the game forces that percentage.

Despite win rate staying the same my rank keeps going down? I started at the equivalent of Archon went up to Legend and then it's just been a slow death ever since then while playing the game off and on. 

Tried picking up the game again recently after over half a year and did the yearly calibration, won most of the games and went... down? From Crusader to Guardian. It's just disheartening and I think I'm done with the game for good this time.

I just don't think there's anything I can do at this point, even if I only play my best rated heroes and get nothing but wins it will take forever to get back up in rank, I have too many items and such to want to create a new Steam account JUST for DotA 2 and start over with nothing.

It's just depressing, I'd hate to quit the game that I've had some good times with and spent so much time on, but being crushed by the game's algorithm with no way back up it seems like is just disheartening. Yeah, I don't know what I could do to improve things.",1652219804

DotA2,Unfair VAC BAN on my account,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it happened to me too.

I used to play this game for A LOT of time years and years ago, then I just started playing something else and played less Dota 2.  
I would randomly play a couple of matches in a year in the last 5 years or so.  
The first sentence I used to say at the beginning of almost EVERY match was ""gg hf please let's keep it clean and not be toxic =) "".  


I am no cheater, I don't offend people while playing and I don't rage on others who don't play the game perfectly.  


One day I turn on my pc on January 2022, log on steam, start Dota 2 and I see that horrible red bar on top saying that I was banned, out of nowhere.

  
The only ""issue"" I had with steam it was the last November 2021 when I realized my steam account has been hacked, my username was ""xD"".That person already changed the email and the password but I managed to sort this straight away by sending to the support details about my card payments and stuff.

I logged a ticket with steam straight away, after a week they told me that they could not remove a ban.

I have no idea what that answers to, as I logged a ticket with them FOR HELP!!!

And since there is no way to log a ticket to Valve, I have no idea of what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I opened steam again after months and I'm still banned.

Dota buff asks for "" Expose Public Match Data "" to be able to show me stats (I don't know why but other people have shared these info with others, probably to prove their innocence showing data?) but as soon as I click to activate that settings and click on the cog icon back to ""save"", it won't do it.  
I click back on social and I still see that  Expose Public Match Data not ticked.  


Guys, honestly, I have no idea of what to do, it just feels frustrating and unfair. I'm not gonna make a new steam account just to play a game that I play twice per year, even if I loved it for SO MUCH TIME.

I'm a good guy, I don't use cheats or verbally abuse anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, help me

DotA2,Help appreciated -&gt; Alt Account got VAC banned,"Hi,

since my alt account suddenly got banned yesterday (game VAC ban) I'm curious for what's the cause of it. Generally a ban of this sort indicates the usage of an external software, which is not allowed. The only software I'm using is overwolfs dotaplus app, which nearly everyone uses in higher brackets and since it's also officialy advertised by overwolf I thought that it wouldn't cause any trouble. I'm a bit confused regarding what the reason behind the ban is.

My questions are therefor:

* Did i get banned for using the app dotaplus?
* Did i get banned for ""smurfing"" or in valves words ""abusing matchmaking""?
* If I've been banned wrongfully, where can I submit a review of my case?

For reference: I've played 26 games, won around 17 games if I remember correctly (can't see my stats anymore). Kept my communication to a minimum -&gt; no swearing or anything. 

As far as i understood from previous posts, there's no statement from valve which forbids multiple accounts, it's only forbidden to abuse the matchmaking.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For the people who ask why I created an alt account: 

I wanted to rerank a little lower since my ""active"" days are gone and my main account is too high to enjoy games, since I don't have that much time to keep up with the game to play at my old rank. No, recalibration is not an option since you can lose 500 mmr at most. And no I have no intention of selling the account or anything in that regard.

Idea is to only be used by healing supports (such as IO, oracle, dazzle, etc) and thus cost must be low. It should prevent carries (such as Necrophos or Juggernaut) from using it, unless they play position 4 or 5 (hard/soft supports).   
  
 If you have an idea for upgrading it further in price and ability (such as the mana affecting the healed unit), you are most welcome to do that in a response comment to your initial one.

DotA2,"Hero Suggestion- Grimgl the Death Bug (Agility Carry, Jungler, auto-attacker)","**Grimgl the Death Bug (Agility Carry, Jungle and Counter-Carry)**

*Of all the creatures in the Jidi Isle, it is the death bug which is possibly most horrific. The larvae burrow into unsuspecting creatures, and consume their unwilling host from the inside. Once gorged on dissolved flesh, they pupate inside their victim, before bursting forth in a new form, dripping with acidic afterbirth, which often kills any would-be scavengers or predators of the newly hatched death bug. Grimgl is something of an anomaly, as unlike most death bugs, which range from 1 to 3 inches, he is nearly 4ft long.*

**1st Ability**

*Burrow*\- Death Bugs prepare to pupate inside unsuspecting foes, consuming them from within, before bursting forth.

Grimgl burrows into an enemy, becoming untargetable for 6 seconds. While Grimgl is burrowed, the burrowed enemy takes damage every second and their movement is slowed. When Burrow ends, Grimgl emerges, dealing damage in an area around his target. If the target dies from the damage of Burrow before it ends, Grimgl emerges, is healed for 5% of his max Health, and the damage dealt in the area around the target is doubled.

**2nd Ability**

*Pre-digest*\- When hunting, death bugs will sometimes vomit up their stomach acid to prepare a meal. Grimgl has found this very useful against metal clad foes…

Grimgl targets an area, and vomits acid. All enemies hit take damage every 0.5 seconds and have their armour reduced.  

**3rd Ability**

*Skittering menace*\- Grimgl is capable of sudden bursts of movement, either to escape a predator, or catch fleeing prey.

Grimgl’s movement speed increases, and depending on what form (see Chrysalis) he is at, gains one of the following

Larva- Cliff Walking

Nymph-Cliff walking and free movement in trees

Death Bug- Cliff walking, free movement in trees and is pushed in the direction Grimgl is facing

Winged Death Bug- Pushed in the direction Grimgl is facing, and unobstructed movement

**Ultimate**

*Chrysalis*\- Death Bugs pupate rapidly to change form, often inside other creatures.

Grimgl purges himself, gains armour, cannot move and heals 5% of his max Health every second for 5 seconds. If this is the first time he has used Chrysalis at this level, he becomes the next form when Chrysalis ends. Grimgl can trigger this ability while burrowed, and if he does, the damage dealt per second and as a burst at the end of Burrow is doubled. If the target dies while Chrysalis and Burrow are active, all remaining healing from Chrysalis is doubled and applied when Burrow ends.

1st Form- Larva (ranged, slow moving, slow attack)

2nd form- Nymph (Ranged, average movement, slow attack)

3rd form- Death Bug (Melee, Average movement, fast attack)

4th Form- Winged Death Bug (Melee, fast movement, fast attack)

Concept

I was inspired by Tiny, and how he changes across the course of the battle, and liked the idea of a Carry designed to box, but rather than just be tanky or lifesteal reliant, hides and jumps around, avoiding being hunted. He’s designed to be able to transition into jungle from lane quite well as a Pos 1, though could also work in offlane relying on off-rune camp stacks similarly to Tide, using Burrow and Pre-digest to quickly farm. The explosion at the end of Burrow is designed to make a choice for enemies, as either they take the damage, but are in a good place to attack Grimgl, or they back off, and potentially allow him to Skittering Menace away. This could allow him to be very mobile in team fights, picking off a support to regain health with burrow and Chrysalis to maintain pressure, or disengaging by emerging early and using Skittering menace to flee. His weakness is a lack of real lockdown, as well as being vulnerable to a co-ordinated team who can keep his burrow target alive and are ready for him to attack.

Possible talents are increasing armour loss from Pre-Digest, increased duration on burrow DoTs and movement slows, and making Burrow pierce magic immunity. Aghs could let him burrow into allies, giving an armour buff, while shard could make Pre-digest have charges. The dream of fitting 4 heroes into one with lifestealer is a possibility as well.",1652201727

# Resources

* I have made a [DPC Fantasy Tracker](https://virendias.github.io/dpc-fantasy/) to help you guys evaluate your results.
* The data I have used to make this post is available in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ExiDnIYbupgsjuSbr9zeaBTXb_xn2N9uyvyD0Gz1bc).

# Data Sources

* The numbers are based on each player's 25 most recent tier 1 and 2 pro matches.
* The data has been acquired from OpenDota and datdota.

#  General Strategy

* **Favour players from teams that will play more series.** Although only the highest-scoring series is counted, players playing more series are more likely to have a better score.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to win their matches.** Core and Mid players score 30–50% more in winning games, and Support players score 10–20% more in winning games.
* **Favour players from teams that are expected to play longer matches.**
* **Favour carry players for the Core slots.** This should be the case 99% of the time. Carry players score just as much in losses, as offlane players score in wins.
* **Favour hard support players for the Support slots.** This primarily hinges on which support places the most observer wards for the team, which may not always be the hard support.

If you get like 6-7 reports for disruptive gameplay, you get sent to low priority even though no1 has convicted you on overwatch. Same with behavior score loss. You lose -500 BS for 4 disruptive gameplay reports because your team scapegoated you one game. The whole point of overwatch was to stop these fake convictions and arbitrary behavior score drops, so why did Valve enable it again?

It can be frustrating at times, and I even have to leave it for weeks after a massive losing streak, But there isn't anything else I can play and be so excited about week after week.

DotA2,"Although originally a good idea, Overwatch in its current state is a complete failure and needs to be revamped","I’m pretty sure that DOTA is in the most toxic state it’s ever been in. I have 10k behavior score and yet 4 of my last 10 and 7 of my last 20 games have had some sort of griefing whether it be shadow amulet/feeding down mid/rage BB into item breaking Ect. 

I genuinely think a major contributor to this is Overwatch, in its current state, being a complete failure. If you don’t think you’ll ever be punished for griefing and on the extremely rare occasion you do get punished it’s just a few games of low priority, I don’t think there’s any deterrence to griefing.

Now in an attempt to not just complain but offer a solution here’s my 2 step plan to fixing Overwatch 

1) Give something, literally anything for doing Overwatch cases. Doesn’t have to be a set, or a drop, just give literally anything to incentivize actually doing them. A displayable trophy showing your correct number of convictions would probably enough to some. One of the issues is that there is more Overwatch cases than reviewers, and proving incentives to completing them could help with this.

2) Griefing convictions should have harsher punishments. Currently you get a few LP games, which are easily completed through party queue and actually can be quite enjoyable. I used to think that all griefing should be multiple month ban, but perhaps that’s too harsh. Instead I think Valve could put out a post showing the punishments for griefing so that the player base is aware of the consequences for their actions and have it begin with a week long matchmaking ban. The punishment increasing the more times one is convicted.  

I’m not sure these are the best solutions, but something’s got to change because in its current state Overwatch is a failure",1652189958

DotA2,The story of a boy and a fixed 50% winrate. / Part 3 - Final,"There is something I haven't told you about John. I'm not sure why have I left it out before. This event was the trigger that forced John to change his attitude and how he looks at the game. 

 The events that you are about to read, happened long before John met Yatoro.

It was a typical day in John's life. The night before when he went to bed, he promised himself that next day he will be productive and that the first the he will do in the morning is to sit down and study for a few hours and clean his room. He promised himself that he won't play Dota the next day. It's no surprise that the first thing he actually did in the morning was a nice game of Dota. The best thing you can do to wake up and kickstart your day is a game of Dota, right? Turns out it wasn't.

Please note that there was no rolequeue when this happened. John started Dota, clicked the Find Match button and the clock started ticking.

Even before the game started, he knew he was going to play Sven. He was in the mood for Sven. He wanted to AFK farm and oneshot people with a crit. His life was dominating him. So he wanted to dominate others. He didn't care about a good team composition or natural pick orders with supports picking first. He wanted to pick carry and play Sven. There is forced 50% winrate anyway, he thought. So why not?

While the system was searching for a game, he was scrolling trough Facebook and Instagram, looking at pictures of hot girls that he can't have. They were mostly from his old high school, and they were hot as hell, living the glamorous Instagram life. Well, he could at least masturbate to the new scene with Danny D and Aletta Ocean and their Overwatch cosplay. As he was getting ready, the annoying super loud ""Match Found"" sound has popped up and he clicked accept. Aletta can wait. Sven can't.

Games before role queue were stressing even before the game started. You could never be sure that you can play the role that you liked. He made sure that he gets to play Sven by firstpicking him and refusing to roll for the carry role. After he firstpicked Sven, he obviously told his teammates what they should pick. John didn't care that the hard support guy is not in the mood for Crystal Maiden. John ordered him to pick Crystal Maiden.

Then something very strange happened. The Hard Support player has indeed picked Crystal Maiden, but there was something very unsettling about her voice. It was a disturbed voice of an older woman, with damaged vocal cords. He told John, that the time has come for his punishment. **In Exactly 1000 days, he will be cursed with physically painful, brain lobotomizing dreams every single night, for his every mistake that he didn't accept or when he blamed others**. Crystal Maiden didn't speak a single word after.

The game basically ended faster than it has started. John didn't buy a BKB on Sven, he didn't land a single autoattack in his ultimate. He played against 3 stuns and 2 slows. He farmed for 30 minutes, died without buyback and the enemy ended the game.

As the game ended, he remembered the old woman's voice. He laughed it off. It was surely some voice modifying software. Has to be. Right? Well, no. As it turned, the curse was real a real nightmare, just like a Hard Support Pudge that misses every single hook and blames you for not carrying the game.

1000 days have passed and the dreams have started.

It was very simple. As John fell asleep, he felt paralyzed. He was sleeping, but it felt like he is awake. He was conscious. In his dream, he was completely tied to a chair and couldn't move an inch. He was barefoot, and barehanded. He could speak and he could see. Oh how he wished he couldn't. The room was dark, all he could see was a big TV screen with Dota main menu. And his profile logged in. He was surprised that someone could log-in on his account in a random place. He was scared for his Dota inventory. As it turned out, it should have been the least of his concerns. He wasn't uncomfortable. The chair he was sitting in seemed comfortable. It was a brand new Secret Lab chair. But he was bored, and scared. He was sitting there for about twenty minutes, when he heard some sickly coughing. He couldn't see that part of the room, it was dark and there was no particular smell. He could have guessed that it's a human being by the cough and the sound of breathing.

Hello John. I'm here to fulfill the curse. Said the dark figure with a sickly, damaged voice. 

John recognized the sound of the vocal cords.

It was the Crystal Maiden player that supposedly used some sound altering software. Except there was no software. It was the old hag. The curse was real. He was dreaming awake. He felt every sensation in his body. And the worse was about to come.

The hag didn't speak too much. She grabbed a mouse, it was a Zowie EC1. It was stained with grease, and the logo was half scratched off from all the usage. She found a game that John has lost and proceeded to download the replay.

The curse was simple.

She forced John to watch the game from his own perspective and whenever big mistakes came up, she slowed the replay to 0,5x speed so John can see it very well, so John can face his own failure. 

John was playing Anti Mage and he was in his jungle. The enemy smoked, but one of the opponents killed John's observer ward, so it was obvious. But John kept farming. He got ganked and said : ""Omg, shit supports. No ward. Get cancer piece of shit""

The hag played the scene over and over on 0,5x speed. John was forced to look. Everytime the scene ended and John message popped up, the hag tried to cut of one of John fingers on his legs. It was really hard to cut, because the knife was dull and rusty. So sometimes the hag would just smash John's fingers with the hilt of the knife, then she would try to cut it again. Then she played the Antimage scene again, John watched and she was mutilating him. He was in immeasurable pain. He was crying, screaming, drooling from his mouth like a little piece of shit he is. A typical toxic blaming piece of shit. 

When he watched the scene 10 times and he lost all of his fingers, the dream ended for that night and he woke up. He was nauseous, he puked many times, could barely walk, he had his fingers but he was afraid to look down. The only thing he could do to forget was what he always does when he tries to escape form reality. Dota. 

It was strange. His teammate missed a spell, he was about to press enter to open chat, but his finger started hurting. He stopped. He swallowed his saliva and kept on playing.

He couldn't escape from the night. As he fell asleep, the terror once again started. He was watching different scenes all over and over. Destroying his own items because his pos5 Kotl killed a creepweave, him playing Lion in some other game when he used Finger for killsteal only so that he missed mana 15 seconds after when they could kill a core with it. Missing lasthits all around, dying outside of base without buybacks. 

Whenever his chat messages popped up, the hag took some fingers. Sometimes she would get bored and puncture his fingers under the nails with a sharp object, or would cut parts of his tongue and feed him. The hag loved John's chat messages.

There was one way to end the terror, and it was saying the following words.

""There is no MMR hell. There is no forced winrate. My account is not cursed and it's not in some sorf of a shadow pool. If any top MMR player took my account, they would boost it up in no time. I am where I belong. I shouldn't flame people on my rank because I have played this game for 5000 hours and I'm still on their rank. It's not because of them. w33ha wouldn't care. w33ha got to top1 leaderboards by randoming heroes. W33ha can carry a bad team. If I want to get MMR I need to play better.""

After some nights, the terror has stopped. There was no dream. There were no nightmares.

When he lost the following Dota game, his first reflex was to flame. But then he remembered. He has made at least 50 mistakes that game, if not more. Had he made less mistakes, he surely would have won. He has to make less mistakes. It is how he will grow as a player. Not by blaming others.

You know the rest of the story. John is now a 6000 player, he still has space to improve. He knows he makes mistakes. He doesn't flame anyone, because he knows that he could also be flamed. 

The legend says that the hag still terrorizes miserable pieces of shit that blame others for their long-term MMR.

Don't flame in your next game. We are all humans, we try our best. Even Messi misses penalties, even Warren Buffet has losing trades. If our teammate has destroyed his items, it means he needs mental help and probably has a very disturbed life. Don't feel angry about him, rather feel sorry for him and offer him your help and forgiveness. And don't forget, you MMR is the most precise representative of your skill level. If you deserve more than 3000, then you should be able to comfortably beat 3000 MMR players. If you think your team is holding you back, give your account to Yatoro. He could win with carry Crystal Maiden in 3000 MMR if he wanted to.

DotA2,Did the latest game break bot behavior for bot matches?,"I know that bot matches shouldn't be Valves first priority, but since at least 7.31c, bots seem to be completely broken. Pretty reliably they have a three man offlane, a solo safe lane and a mid that is running circles in the jungle, not doing anything until they are either killed or something else happend. Did anyone else observe that behavior? I often play bot games (solo) for stupid stuff or to chill and even on unfair it feels like you are cheating. Not that they where really that hard before, but now it feels pointless when they only start to play the midlane at minute 10 or so.",1652180065

DotA2,ESL One Stockholm 2022 Day 1 Fantasy Guide,"I'm back to provide fantasy predictions for Day 1 of the Major(and hopefully I'll be able to make these guides for every following day). My schedule is kinda busy over the next few days but I will do my best to cover each day.

I won't be making another guide on the system itself(you can check my TI10 day 1 post if you're curious about that or ask any questions in the comments and I will answer them) and will just proceed to go with my predictions.

2 resources I used for this are [Liquipedia's page on the major](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/ESL_One/Stockholm/2022) for cross-checking the schedules and [this tool] (https://virendias.github.io/dpc-fantasy/) by u/Hawkie74 for checking scores of the regionals(for initial days) as well as the scores during the major itself, his tool tracks all the important data and without it as such this would not be possible. Be sure to check out his guides as well if he makes them, before you decide on your final choices. If you don't want to read the reasoning behind which teams/players to play, skip to the recommended players section below. Now onto the guide.

**Relevant Teams**
14 teams, 2 groups of 7 and 6 games per day means that there are 2 teams in each group that only play 1 series a day and the others play 2. Which means that we have 10 teams for consideration on Day 1 which are OG, GG, BB, Spirit, Fnatic, Boom, EG, TSM, bc and TA as per liquipedia.

The secret of fantasy is to pick high scoring players in games that are gonna be close. 

I don't believe in either of the SA teams(bc and TA) so will instantly remove them from consideration. Any teams that play against them as well as MG(who I also don't believe to be very good) will be valued less than the other options.

While the NA players do show decent promise, everyone from EG and TSM except Arteezy have terrible scores. While that could just be due to NA being one sided and they might score better here, I'm not a fan of taking risks Day 1 so will not be considering them either, apart from maybe Arteezy.

Both the SEA teams, BOOM and fnatic have amazing scores, particularly the carries and mids and they are up for consideration. TIMS and skem from BOOM also have amazing scores in comparison with the rest of the support pool and are almost an insta lock.

OG has good scorers on Yuragi and bzm but the rest of the team is just not worth playing, the supports in particular score so low that they are stricken from consideration, especially since one of their games is vs bc. Yuragi and bzm only players worth playing.

Gaimin gladiators have 2 slightly above average scorers in dyrachyo and seleri and one slightly below average scorer in boom, their mid but not high enough to warrant consideration over the rest of the pool imo.

For the EEU games, for some reason I cannot find the tourney on Hawkie's tool so if somebody has data for that, I would appreciate it if they could send it to me and I'll edit that in. For now I have to go off Tour 1 data, which does not have BB's data as they just came from Div 2. One of BB's games is against bc anyway so I wasn't gonna consider them. For Team Spirit, TorontoTokyo, Yatoro and Miposhka are all worth playing if you expect their respective games to be close.

**Recommened players in each role**

Core: Raven=Jacky=Yatoro &gt; Yuragi=Arteezy &gt; Dyrachyo

Mid: Armel=TorontoTokyo &gt; Yopaj &gt; bzm

Supports: TIMS=skem &gt; Miposhka=Jaunuel=DJ &gt; Seleri

as usual prioritise supports with observer wards bonus",1652175450
DotA2,I watched Arcane and I think it's overpraised. (Hear me out first),"I'm not a Dragon's Blood Fanboy either, but whoever voiced Invoker bruh, he's a god, he's a god of voice acting. Who was that? 

Either way, back on the track. I'll keep it short and sweet as possible.

So after reading a post about Arcane being better than Dota Dragon's Blood, on which the creator of Dragon's Blood even agreed and said his friend also worked on Arcane and the show is actually better than Arcane. 

I'm sorry dude, I'm not calling DotA Dragon's Blood a masterpiece but Arcane isn't either, plus it has some woke element which is fine because I always see any piece clear headed and try to grasp the messages, symbolism, ester eggs etc., 

Arcane was far superior in animation. It captured the essence of that 2D + 3D mixture and it was one of the unique animations I've ever seen, also the music, the hype around the show, the world settings, it's so cool to gaze but it is extremely painful to watch, 40 minutes nothing but a boring lore that wasn't executed well? 

After watching Arcane with a rational mind and just sitting there thinking there was nothing in it, the series was hollow and awful, there WAS nothing there in terms of creativeness and writing and lore, it's just some random bunch of stuff assembled together, even if I knew lore of League I wouldn't praise such poor execution. 

Look at Witcher 3 for example, books are outstanding and the game is also great because the lore and the world, quests, character everything is done right, whilst in Arcane you are just waiting, back on your sit for someone to explain something what is what, and why is this character even likable, jinx for example seems like a cheap Harley rip off. 

I mean, for me the show was totally boring. Even Dota Dragon's Blood wasn't great. I only watched Dragon Blood because whoever that god was, who voiced Invoker and because of the Terrorblade, like the goosebumps ooooh! But yeah, I can only remember two good things about the show. It was pretty random, like Arcane as well.",1652173541

I Bloody love this game so much. I watch every tournament. Major and TI times are like christmas to me. I've been playing it for a decent amount of time because I love dota. its such a fun game. and despite all the toxicity i kept carrying on with a smile. every flame i reply with a &lt;3. i did all i could to spread positivity to every game. but after today my friend and i uninstalled this beautiful game filled with too many bad people for the last time. were literally playing low ranked turbos for fun. its a bloody video game that we want to play and enjoy. its goddamn 1k turbos why is everyone so toxic, i swear ive seen the worst humans alive in this game alone, and i met 100s of new people weekly from my job. like yeah you cant let one or two or 20 or 50 random 10 year olds ruin your day. but when its every single day in every single game. in turbos in arcades, yes ARCADES which ive played for years is getting so bad. and its a team game ive met some great friends from this i dont want to have to play a game where you open the matches muting everyone its so dumb. and ive taken breaks that kept getting longer and longer. recently i took 2 month break because the toxicity started affecting me outside of the game i was just always tilted. and now im done for good, i cant even load the game up without feeling dread. i have a lot more to rant about but no energy so ill leave it at that. goodnight forever",1652158753

If all neutral item come out in min 7, 17, 27 and 37; why valve wait 23 mins more for end a game.  
All games at this point, at least, are or, very satisfacted, or not really fun for loose or win after 1.xx hour. So, i spect, at least, wait for item 5 items, for min 47 or 50.

DotA2,Custom Game Restriction Workaround,"I see a lot of people are having trouble with the Arcade today, specifically with the message ""*One or more members of the party are restricted from playing custom games* *at this time"",* as was I.

After searching Google and reddit for a while, I couldn't find a fix and saw lots of posts complaining about it, so I went into one of my favorite custom games' Discord to see what they were saying about this, and they found a simple workaround.

All you have to do is play a **normal match** of Dota 2. They recommended **Turbo** mode as it's faster than a normal match. That is what I've tested and can confirm it works as of 05/10. 

Bot matches haven't been tested. If anyone cares to go through that effort for the community, please post it here so I can update this post. 

Credits to **Pitou**, one of Guarding Athena's Discord moderators!

PS: This workaround is not meant for the 1 hour bans, at least not that I know of, it's specifically for the message mentioned at the start of the post, as it's a bug that hit many of us for no apparent reason and **needs fixing** from Valve.",1652155656

DotA2,New player with some questions,"First off, I tried searching but couldn't find whether or not this game has a solo q ranked mode? If it does, is it good/do most people play the game that way? 

Secondly, ive heard people say that this game is not super active in North America compared to other regions. Is this true? Does it affect que times at all? Im assuming its prolly over exaggerated, but I'm from NA East so just curious.

Lastly, at what point did you start to get somewhat of an understanding of the game? I know it's different for everyone but if it takes most people hundreds of hours to know the basics I might want to rethink how I want to approach the game. 

Overall I'm really enjoying the game so far, it's lots of fun! Even when I'm doing bad I feel like I'm learning a ton every round. Anyway, those are all my questions. I would be glad if anyone has any answers. Thanks!",1652152863

DotA2,SEA In-House League (SEAL),"Ever wondered if there’s a place where you can play without meeting random toxic pubs, or playing against smurfs in your bracket that are hindering your growth? Want to have human teammates instead of animals?  
Then, you can come and join us at SEAL, where everyone can have more fun playing organized games where teamwork and communication is key. There are no requirements on the rank required, and the games will be played in Captain’s Mode, where communication in drafting and choosing heroes will ensure a more complex game structure with deeper strategy.  
The games hosted in this server will be ticketed and recorded in the server, thus, the replay will be more accessible to people who aren’t playing. Occasional tournaments will also be hosted with a prize pool.   
Currently, we are only hosted in SEA, so only SEA players will be able to play without ping issues and have a smooth gaming environment. (There are no plans for other regions atm.)  
If you want to have a fun time and a more engaging community where players are willing to help each other out, whilst maintaining a higher quality game, this is the place for you. The times where we usually play will be around 2100 (GMT+8/SGT) to 0000 (GMT+8/SGT).   
We will be waiting for you over here at SEAL.   
**P.S. Only requirement here is “don’t be an animal.”**

DotA2,I hate Primal Beast.,"I hate Primal Beast. I hate it. I hate its crocodile face. I hate its fists. I hate its yelling. I hate when the yell is followed up by the fists and I hate when the fists are followed up by the yell. I hate that Primal Beast pulls 1000 damage out of its scaly asshole at minute 5 and then descends on me like a Vogon at a poetry convention.


I hate the Primal Beast. I hate it because it is broken. It says it has less than 50% winrate on dotabuff. This is patently false, because I have an awful winrate against it with my supports who are held together with pritt stick and prayer. I do not have a huge lizard constructed out of pectoral muscles and galvanized coffin nails.


I hate that it shouts at me. It doesn't make sense when it yells and it is incomprehensible while it devours my cores like a slim jim.


I hate its passive. I hate that surrounding it simply prompts it to pull out a US general's helmet so it can yell about 'now we can trample in any direction'. I hate that its reaction to a barrage of attacks is to become somewhat peeved. I have looked Primal Beast in its smug scaly face as a shitstorm of arrows hit it that would destroy any other early game brawler. He went from :I to &gt;:I , killed me and my windrunner because I foolishly allowed it to press E and W while it chased me with 1500 hp at minute 6.


I have resolved to murder it from ranged with everything I can think of. Every single moment is spent trying to kill Primal beast. All of the Primal Beast Women and the Primal Beast Children too. I hate them. I no longer see the objective, the ancient, because there is nothing but shrapnel and proximity mines everywhere. I hate that it barely stops it. I hate that it keeps coming while shouting at me, or yelling at no one at all, it just yells and shouts. I will never be able to go to a zoo with crocodiles because it would give me heart palpitations.


I hate that Primal Beast can solo a lane from minute 0 with his pos 4 roaming around winning other lanes, who then also comes to lane once I've sent Primal Beast to the shadow realm for the first time.


I hate that the recent nerf makes no difference. I hate that it will be in end game, if I reach it, where I might have a miniscule chance to not instantly die, I may be able to stun it before it devours me like I'm an afternoon snack. I hate that while I was writing this Primal Beast once again picked me up and smoked me like a cigar. I hate Primal Beast.",1652133924

DotA2,Dota Plus should have unlimited roles queue because P5 really sucks.,"I enjoy playing dota (mostly offlane) but absolutely dislike playing P5 specifically for a few reasons.

When I play P5, 80% of the games the carry is complaining about something. They take reckless actions and expect me to fix it like:

-Getting caught and pinging for regen/salve as if I can just conjure them. 
-They push the lane and want immediate pulls
-Want me to harass and then ping there is no stack
-There can be 10 wards on the map and they still cry about vision because they died farming the same pattern for the past 10min.
-50%+ of the games I don't even understand what they say because I'm queued with spanish people in US EAST/WEST. All they do is ping 300 times and spam wheel.
-If I take 1 creep by mistake or because it was going to be denied, they cry and spend 2min typing ""REPORT PLS""

I can give them the best lane and possible but they will throw it away because they want to farm for 30min.

It's a lose/lose situation, the games are not fun and a waste of time, so for the love of god either fix the P5 role so it's not a slave half of the game to P1 or let me queue the role I want by having Dota Plus without having to refill roles.",1652127486

Is making a non-commercial game considered as ""distributing assets separately"" ?

DotA2,Hard Carry Hero Concept,"Hi all,

This is a rework of a hard carry hero concept I had previously posted for fun. The numbers would obviously need to be tuned after gameplay testing, but I hope this reworked concept is simpler and better tailored to the hard carry role. Hopefully you enjoy the lore and concepts! 

Kiwetenwi, the Windigo  

In ancient days, at the northern pole of a blue planet, malevolent wind spirits tormented and consumed the living things that encroached upon their domain. The first peoples of these frozen wastes would fall prey to possession by these northern wind spirits. Those possessed would remain in an undying and perpetually malnourished state, forever hungry. The natives of this region held to strict traditions in order to evade these spirits and deal with the Windigo -- those possessed by ravenous spirits. 

As time went on settlers began moving northward in quest of precious minerals hidden below the permafrost. Contact between the settlers and the native northerners was initially limited to trade, but this balance was soon upset as settlers began displacing native Northerners. All out war soon followed. It was this time of terror and madness that created the unstoppable Windigo Kiwetenwi.

Bonus lore:

What follows is the most popular origin legend of Kiwetenwi the Windigo:

All the men in a small indigenous fishing village had been recruited for war against the settlers. The daughter of the village chief, a skilled hunter, was left in charge. One day while out on a hunting trip, the chief's daughter and her two companions got caught out in a sudden unexpected blizzard. The three decided to hunker down and wait out the storm. During the night the chief's daughter was visited by spirits within the storm in her dreams. The spirits showed her images of a band of raiding settlers headed toward her village. The desperation and fear of the young woman were used by the spirits to elicit a deal -- they would provide her with the strength to protect her people if she provided them access to her body. The next afternoon the girl awoke in a mental haze, alone out in the still raging snowstorm, and covered in blood. She then remembered her people, and rushed home. Unfortunately her arrival was too late. Bodies of her tribe were scattered through the village. At the sight of the bodies the girl became desperately hungry and to her horror she began devouring the dead flesh of her people. Weeping as she tore through muscle and sinew, her hunger and rage towards the settlers only grew. Once the village was clean of bodies and covered in new snow, the woman set off to enact her vengeance. The wrath of Kiwetenwi the Windigo continues to this day, bringing with her a perpetual winter.

DotA2,Did you get a rampage recently?,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

I downloaded the openshot video editor and it seems quite different to what I normally use. It got some features I really like and thinking about the possibilities the last couple of days. I'd like to edit a Dota 2 highlight video with it, but don't have any material at hand; did you by any chance get a rampage or made a really nice play recently that you'd like to see on youtube? Please post the match ID and a timestamp/hero to watch in the comments and I promise I'll reply to at least one comment with a link. But maybe more. Or maybe I'll make a compilation of multiple plays in one video. Skill level doesn't matter, neither the complexity of the play, it just needs to look good! :) 

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate you reading my post.",1652123401
DotA2,Worth going pro?,"For about 6 years now I have always dreamed about going pro on Dota 2. I try filling every avaliable slot of time in my busy work + study + relationship life to play. I want to try to go pro by spending 12 hours a day for a year playing, but doing so would cost me my relationship, my funds and set me back 1 year career-wise if i'm to not succeed.  


Highest rank I've been is ancient 3. But my biggest concern is not my rank but rather that I'm 25 and that the game is losing players. I keep comming back and feel myself so drawn to the game endlessly, not just as a distraction or hobby, but as a sport. Would you risk it all if you could if you were in my situation?",1652123369
DotA2,My take on Mirana,,1652123218
DotA2,[Bug] Armlet drains less health than it should.,"Since we are fixing a lot of bugs before the major beginning, thought I'd bring attention to this one again.

Armlet was patched in 7.31 to drain 45 hp per second, but it is still draining 40.

https://preview.redd.it/wvkwjiarxhy81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c63bf02031a8fd5a3eb687f20c301ff3786da7ee

A 40 hp regen hero doesn't lose hp with armlet on. Plus the combat logs show drain rate is 4 hp per 0.1 sec.",1652122342
DotA2,Nerf buybacks,"Cd should be way over 10-12 mins not 8. We kill the hc, he buybacks then they push to our base which takes like 3 minutes near the ramp. We clean them, get to their base its now like 6 mins after his buyback, we brawl at the racks for a few mins, he respawns dies and then buy backs again. What is this bullshit. We won but there was no fun.  It was the same with the entire enemy team. Buyback galore. Either increase the gold requirement or increase the cooldown.",1652121442
DotA2,How to follow DoTA 2 esports as a football fan?,"Hey, everyone! I'm a football fan, but I'd like to look at DoTA 2 esports. But I'm confused about its current state. In football, I'm a Manchester United fan, which used to at least be #1 English football contender, and also be a strong barrier for rivals in Champions League. In football, there are unique personalities such as Sir Alex Ferguson, the fatherly manager who kept on reinventing Man. United squad through eras. Pep Guardiola with his ""modern"" style, centered around ball possession, positional advantage, and space exploitation. Or defensive managers like Jose Mourinho, Diego Simeone, Antonio Conte, etc, who love to either park the bus (crowding the penalty box to prevent opponents from scoring), or rigidly move back and forth as an unit. There are also humble players like Lionel Messi, Luka Modric, Harry Kane, etc who don't have any meaningful drama off rhe pitch. There are flashy players like Neymar, Paul Pogba, Memphis Depay, Jesse Lingard, etc. 



Does any player coach, or team something like that? I mean, are there teams, players, or managers with distinct styles? Which are ultra offensive and defensive sides (or people)? Which ones are playing direct? Which ones like to do flashy things, and their antithesis? Which ones can play with limited space, or need big space to fully contribute to the team? Is there mental war, foul-mouthed exchange, or anything done to distract opponents? Which ones are most likeable, and vice versa? 



Sorry if I offend anyone here, but it's hard for me to follow esports when I don't have anyone to root for. And I don't know where to start, and esports also haven't become the cultural part for societies. I mean, I've never seen any esports fanbase like The Red Army, Madridsta, Barcelonista, Milanisti, Juventini, Interisti, Romanisti, and many more, so it's hard for me to follow esports. 


This is actually an edited copy of my first post about how to follow esports but with LOL. And since DoTA 2 is actually a flexible game which gives the ultimate freedom to experiment, then I'm even more intrigued to follow the game's pro scene.And is it true that once we understand DoTA intimately, we can enjoy the game even as a spectator?

DotA2,Add an option to only move with right clicks.,"I use the attack hotkey with quick attack enabled to issue an attack command. I think there's a lot of people who do this. I also use the auto repeat right mouse option. When I hold my right mouse button and drag my mouse, sometimes I accidentally issue an attack command and draw creep/tower aggro or reveal my position. I have no reason to use the right click to issue an attack command: I only use my attack hotkey to attack.

Luckily there's a way to avoid these misclicks. If you set ""dota_player_simplified_controls"" to 1, the right click only issues move commands. This is what I want. Sadly, this option also makes your left mouse button act as an attack hotkey. Trying to select an enemy with this option on issues an attack command on that enemy instead.

It would be ideal to have an option that replicates dota_player_simplified_controls's changes to the right mouse button while retaining the default left mouse button behaviour.",1652116923

DotA2,Beating matchmaking,"I've started to do something that may just be me going crazy but seems to help grind MMR.

I only queue mid and grind up. After playing literally 10+ games a day a pattern started to emerge.

4-5 ez wins, then suddenly my supports become horrifically bad at the game. The biggest problems are they don't know where to be on the map and they position and play like cores. Ie: they will distribute themselves as far as possible away from other cores and then use spells on creeps hoping to tp to fights as necessary.

So I came up with a plan. When I notice my supports getting worse; I will queue mid and then offer them mid. These people want to afk farm essentially so I'll give them a role where that is remotely acceptable... And take the supp role and support the shit out of the game with an Enigma or some other high impact support hero.


It.. works.

They afk farm flawlessly! I notice some of the lanes are actually difficult to play but with enough pulling, blocking, aggro tricks and mechanics they are winnable but the lane would've lost for sure if it had some afk farming support there instead of me.",1652054946

DotA2,CHINA Div1 DPC season 2 (&amp; Vici Gaming stand-in issue leading to forfeit),"China's DPC season 2 took hits due to strict COVID lockdowns originally focused on Shanghai (but it now seems to be tightening in other cities).

This resulted in the pause of their season (paused after week 3, 29th March), because China's DPC was played in a production studio in Shanghai, so the season had to be placed on hold because movement was ABSOLUTELY CONTROLLED.

It was estimated to resume on April 8. Due to the COVID situation (likely) not improving and lockdown measures not being relaxed, [it was then announced to resume on 12th April.](https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/chinese-dpc-league-pushes-back-restart-date-due-to-lockdowns) 

No further delays occurred and the remaining DPC season was condensed into 2 weeks (12 April to 24 April) with tiebreakers happening on 25th April. All these were originally meant to determine which teams would go to the STOCKHOLM MAJOR. But that was scuppered due to the further lockdowns and [replaced with a Regional Finals](https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/china-dpc-2021-22-tour-2-regional-final-schedule-results-and-other-details).

**&gt;&gt; Here's the fun part** (and I only went down the rabbit hole after watching OG's podcast [where Notail and Ceb spoke to Moonmeander](https://youtu.be/JQnuTrPWiaQ?t=2450)):  
Vici Gaming (VG) kicked their offlane player ""IRVING"" very early in the season *(22 Feb, for context Roster lock was 27 Feb)* [and officially decided to bring in ""YANG"" as a replacement](https://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/news/56298-yang-returns-to-vici-gaming) on 17 March.

However it's mid-season, and Yang could only play as a stand-in. According to the rules, a stand-in only has a limited number of series he could take part in (by my calculations, 4 series)

All this while, Irving (who was officially still a VG DPC-registered player) played 3 out of 4 series before the lockdown happened (all losses) and Yang played the 2nd series (18 March, day after the announcement of his return). Yang also took part in the 3 remaining series VG had, after the resumption of CN DPC (all 4 series he played were wins for VG).

Hilariously, VG had to play tiebreakers with Royal Never Give up (RNG) for a chance to go to the Major (that eventually was replaced with a Regional Finals). And Yang became ineligible (reached the Stand-in limit).

*SUPPOSEDLY, VG went to IRVING and asked (more likely BEGGED) him to come back for tiebreakers. And IRVING supposedly said no (VG claimed he had back problems, but most people speculated that he was giving VG the big middle finger).* [So it ended in a VG forfeit (&amp; 2-0 win for RNG).](https://twitter.com/PWRD_DOTA2/status/1518473095924781056) VG obviously missed out on the [regional finals](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Dota_Pro_Circuit/2021-22/2/China/Regional_Final).

It does behave like a normal bot, but it never tries to use shop, skill abilities and use any items other than tp. This has nothing to do with difficulty - players which were bots right from the start behave normally.

I remembet that this behavior was normal at the first time this feature was added (with the bot matchmaking UI remake), then it eventually got fixed. So please, fix it again :)

\------------

Regarding this, the bot does not assume control if a player is afk for a long time - should be fixed as well.

\-----------

And the final proposal would be also useful for ""real"" matchmaking:

\- If a player gets kicked due to afk, other players should be able to control that one (same as dc).

\- If a player can be controlled by other players (afk/dc), the teammates can still control them until the returning player makes an action.",1652036929

I would like to certain some premises. First, all games in the tournament are seriously treated, which means the players did their best in every single game, even on the group stage. Since everyone wants to enter the higher bracket, they should do their best to win. Secondly, a formal match takes much higher weight than a practicing match which is private and unknown to the public. I support this view mainly because a team doesn't have much spare time to practice privately in the group stage. In addition, two teams won't practice with each other if they have a match coming, so no recent practicing games would change their mind on drafts. I suppose all teams acknowledged each other mainly from their formal matches, and prepare for drafting.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I create this project, which set a filter to the date just before each game and restores the situation of making the draft. I did have some incomplete thoughts but I want to hear from everyone how you look at pro's drafting. Please share your opinion down below.",1652035989

A1: Yesterday it was just us giving away 2 games, and with them being a bit too cocky, I felt like we should just beat them and remind them who they are.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q2: On the last 2 fights of game 3, for a monment it felt kind of dangerous when underlord ported the whole team to the enemy base to get the barracks. Did you ever worry about losing the fight face to face against them and potentially lead to bigger problems?**

A2: Nah that's just impossible, at that point I could even win the game with my foot on the mouse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3: Up till now, are you satisfied with your own performance?**

A3: Yeah I am qutie satisfied, and I do hope the team could keep this up in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q4: Is there any hero that you want to pick personally but eventually was turned down by the team during this series?**

A4: I wanted to play Alchemist to be honest, they(Team Aster) basically do not invade us at all. So I could just farm up a radiance and BKB in the first 10 minutes and crush them. But it was not picked.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q5: 10 minutes radiance and BKB? I kinda want learn how to do that Mr.Ame.**

A5: Yeah the timing is pretty much it.

&gt;Fun Fact: the statement of getting radiance and bkb on a 10 minutes-ish timing is possible because Ame used to play against Ana in a matchup where Ana got both items in 12-13 minutes and rolled through them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Q6: After the series there's gonna be a long break, what would you do during the break?**

A6: Play some other games I guess, just chilling.

&gt;Fun Fact 1:Ame broke up with his last girl friend around 6 months ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fun Fact 2: Ame's recently having a affair with a big Vtuber named 阿梓 (Azi) in China and they were playing It Takes Two on stream and the chemistry between them is insane. He even incorporated Azi's name in his in-game ID. As of now their relationship is not confirmed and they have not meet each other in real world due to the travel restrictions in Shanghai.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q7: If you have to choose, who's gonna be the MVP of this season from your team?**

A7: It's definitely Faith-bian, his performance is not only excellent but also incredibly consistent across the season with a huge hero pool to play with. This man is an absolute giga-chad.

&amp;#x200B;

**And that's the end of the interview.**

&amp;#x200B;

Ame may seem a little bit aggressive here in this interview but this is not without a reason. Yesterday when Team Aster's PQ was interviewed, he referred to Ame as “处长”，a rather toxic nickname referencing ""畜生""(swear used in China meaning something like animal or beast). And PQ actually said that he looked forward to LGD coming back and stomp them 3-0, which they did. However, I do believe this is just some not-so-serious banters between these players and nothing is really personal here.

Anyway, what a game to watch, thanks both Aster and LGD for playing some good dota.",1652026892

**Q2: On the last 2 fights of game 3, for a monment it felt kind of dangerous when underlord ported the whole team to the enemy base to get the barracks. Did you ever worry about losing the fight face to face against them and potentially lead to bigger problems?**

A2: Nah that's just impossible, at that point I could even win the game with my foot on the mouse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3: Up till now, are you satisfied with your own performance?** 

A3: Yeah I am qutie satisfied, and I do hope the team could keep this up in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q4: Is there any hero that you want to pick personally but eventually was turned down by the team during this series?**

A4: I wanted to play Alchemist to be honest, they(Team Aster) basically do not invade us at all. So I could just farm up a radiance and BKB in the first 10 minutes and crush them. But it was not picked.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q5: 10 minutes radiance and BKB? I kinda want learn how to do that Mr.Ame.**

A5: Yeah the timing is pretty much it.

Fun Fact: the statement of getting radiance and bkb on a  10 minutes-ish timing is possible because Ame used to play against Ana in a matchup where Ana got both items in 12-13 minutes and rolled through them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q6: After the series there's gonna be a long break, what would you do during the break?**

A6: Play some other games I guess, just chilling. 

&gt;Fun Fact 1:Ame broke up with his last girl friend around 6 months ago.   
&gt;  
&gt;Fun Fact 2: Ame's recently having a affair with a big Vtuber named 阿梓 (Azi) in China and they were playing It Takes Two on stream and the chemistry between them is insane. He even incorporated Azi's name in his in-game ID. As of now their relationship is not confirmed and they have not meet each other in real world due to the travel restrictions in Shanghai. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q7: If you have to choose, who's gonna be the MVP of this season from your team?**

A7: It's definitely Faith-bian, his performance is not only excellent but also incredibly consistent across the season with a huge hero pool to play with. This man is an absolute giga-chad.

&amp;#x200B;

**And that's the end of the interview.**

&amp;#x200B;

Ame may seem a little bit aggressive here in this interview but this is not without a reason. Yesterday when Team Aster's PQ was interviewed, he referred to Ame as “处长”，a rather toxic nickname referencing ""畜生""(swear used in China meaning something like animal or beast). And PQ actually said that he looked forward to LGD coming back and stomp them 3-0, which they did. However, I do believe this is just some not-so-serious banters between these players and nothing is really personal here. 

Anyway, what a game to watch, thanks both Aster and LGD for playing some good dota.",1652026297

***Weak Muscles***

1.Rhomboids

2.Middle and Lower Trapezius

3. Serratus Anterior

4. Rotator Cuff (Shoulder stabilator muscles)

***Tight Muscles***

1.Chest muscles

2.Latissimus Dorsi

3.Upper Trapezius

4.Sternocleidomastoideus

5.Levator Scapulae

How to Fix Rounded Shoulders Posture?

**Restoring muscle balance in the upper body is a key to correcting rounded shoulders.**

Focus on:

* Improving the flexibility of the chest and front shoulder muscles.

DotA2,"What's the best DOTA hero, character-wise?","By ""character-wise"" I mean:

-Unique and original concept behind the character (an example of this done wrong is Primal Beast, who is literally just a generic primal beast)

-Voicelines that focus more on the hero's personality than their visual gimmicks (Jakiro fails miserably at this, his voicelines are literally ""haha look at us we have both fire and ice wow so unique"")

-Abilities that go well with the character's personality (if a hero has a calm and calculated personality, for example, then their abilities should be slow but powerful; if a hero is a quick-witted trickster, then they should be mobile and annoying to deal with.

Now, I'm a part of a group that has plagued this world with its existence for twelve years now, a group fundamentally evil and toxic known as ""League players"".

But I've gotta say, in my experience, Dota's character designs haven't been making it a lot easier to switch to Dota for me. I just can't help but feel like League has been doing a much better job of storytelling through a character's visual design and animations, and creating a compelling world through its inhabitants alone.

I want to believe DOTA can do that too.

So I'm asking you guys. Lore nerds and fanfiction writers of DOTA 2, will you please share with me me the most interesting and unique character designs in this game?",1652010869

One thing that's bothering me more than anything is telekinesis, and I _keep fucking it up_. I usually panickedly mash the buttons, so not only do I fuck up on picking someone up, but the game doesn't let me re-target the landing after the first time it's selected, and on top of that, teammates can't see where it's going. Did I mix up memories? I could swear that there uswd to be a big red circle showing where the enemy will land to your teammates, to the point that it was ""common courtesy"" to not reposition the landing after the first second to not screw your followup's pre-positioning.

But, for me personally, vector targetting would be a salvation. Outside of trying to cliff someone, the entire ""choose a landing point"" part is archaic _and_ fidgety, and I'd rather be able to get both parts of the spell done in one motion...

Also, aghs double spells should rotate (ie first spell on D, but when you get a 2nd spell, shove the first from D to F, and so on); I already played a couple of games with him and still don't understand what happens if I have aghs and pick grab spells A&gt;B&gt;A&gt;C...

&amp;nbsp;

We have a discord community for all ranks and mmrs that want to play inhouse 5v5 captain's mode and 5 man party queues. During the day we run party queues and during the weekends and some week nights we have organised inhouse games.
 
&amp;nbsp;

The 5 man party queues are a great way for everyone to play in a much more relaxed and chill setting, while the inhouses are a great way for people to learn drafting and deeper strategy.

&amp;nbsp;

This is a great place for new players to learn and find people who are friendly to teach them stuff about Dota. For the more seasoned players we have been running as many inhouse games as possible to engage in some more organised games that will require teamwork. It's also been really great to see new people joining and taking the initiative to organise their own groups to play with.

&amp;nbsp;

Discord invite link: https://discord.gg/qt7A3ZPvSG

&amp;nbsp;

Some things to consider:

- Our server is based in AU/SEA server, so most games will be played on these two servers.

- Entry to Discord requires some basic info to be posted in a verification channel such as preferred region and role, rank, behaviour score, the reason you want to join.

- Verification process won't take long, so it won't be much of a hassle.

&amp;nbsp;

Any other questions you can reply here or in Discord.

Thanks for considering and hope to see you there soon! (We have a few inhouses tonight which you can join as well.)",1651997632

DotA2,Huskar was speedrunning,,1651983378
DotA2,Add networth to core gameplay.,"The little networth numbers under the kill count that shows up when you observe a game should be added to the in game display. I feel this would have a net gain to the game. Obviously you’re going to have some drawbacks. The carry dies, sees enemy is 2k net worth ahead and then goes shadow amulet. On the other hand though, an offlaner having a rough lane would see that their team is actually up by 2k networth won’t go shadow amulet.

In the end, over a year or so, I think the benefits would outweigh the negatives. Low mmr players will be affected the most. They will see the value of farming and having a higher networth than the opponent, and reading the changes to the networth over a game will alert pub players to change their game plans, maybe. Also, biggest of all is this won’t affect Immortal bracket players at all because they already have a good idea of how to estimate networth differences based on items.

For those saying networth isn’t everything, duh. That’s what the entire rest of the UI is for. This just gives more information to the players who don’t know how to estimate it based off available data. I liken it to the addition of the “gold to afford quick buy and buyback”.",1651983130

DotA2,Valve should bring back arcanas during TI's,"Previous arcanas that are no longer purchasable is two edged sword for marketing, even though FOMO making people buy it. I believe it is also making you lose money due to forcing people into account buying, being unattractive for new players and for people who were absent during battlepass.
I myself were busy with health issues during last battle pass so i couldn't play and get the arcana for my favorite hero. Even though many people addressed this before i just wanted to shout out again since next TI is on the door. I believe bringing them back with a better marketing would satisfy community and benefit the devs more than this.",1651979026

Swipe damage increased from 20/30/40/50 to 25/40/55/70

Smash damage reduced from 30/60/90/120 to 25/40/55/70

Level 10 Talent +30 swipe damage replaced with +25 swipe/smash damage 

\--------------------------------------

As you can see, the damage of starbreaker is 75-75-64, which means only the swipe damage got increased by talent.

I still have so much to learn and people are kinda ruining the experience and the games for me i dont get it. Happens almost every other game, especially if i play well i get flamed. If i do bad i get flamed cause im a supposed smurf who should be stomping. Only time im left alone it seems like is when i do mediocre or if someone else is carrying hard.

DotA2,Party Matchmaking Abuse,"Party matchmaking (as 5) above 6.5k is literally dead and full of abuse parties. Every second game we meet uncalibrated people with 90% win rate on dotascout who play insanely well and smooth.   
Look at this one, my 6.8k avg party vs two hundreds and one 400 (other two were uncalibrated, of course). Just so you know, the difference between us is huge. These two guys on screenshot have nearly 10000-10500 mmr which is fucking 3-3.5k above our level. Yet we were matched to play a game, which resulted in -20 (not -5 for example as it could have been before).  
Which is... fucking sad, because now I just can't queue as 5 with friends

DotA2,"Small QoL Request: More Accurate Showing of Disabled Abilities of CC like Hex, Silence, Break, etc","I have a QoL request that would have saved me a lot of time researching things as I was learning the game.

It would be very helpful to have the bars that show up over abilities when a hero is silenced/muted/etc to truly represent what is actual not working when under the influence of any CC, whether it be silence, hex, break, mute, etc.  Right now it doesn't show that accurately.

For instance, if silenced, even passive abilities like Warpath, Dispersion, etc, will have the bars over the ability even though the passives are still active.  The same holds true with Hex.  Likewise, when a hero is influenced by Break, no abilities are barred, including passives that are no longer working as a result of the Break status.  


Even more so, it would help in cases where there's talents that change the effects of an ability like Rasta's ""Hex Breaks"" ability that it would be good to see that if you're a target of that ability to know that you are broken as well as Hexed accurately.  


This seems like this would be a small change, but would certainly help with the learning curve of understanding the real affects of CC on one's hero and all the different ways one can get disabled during the game.  I know it might get a bit complicated with abilities that have both an active and passive part, where they are only partly disabled, but that could be solved with some half barred graphic or something more creative than I can come up with.",1651963436
DotA2,Please stop reporting me :(,"Heya. So, I'm a career support, been doing it since WC3 dota. I'm a nice person, team player, sweat my ass off for the team pretty much every game... and then I make the mistake of talking on comms. My voice has been compared to Tiny Tina, Louise from Bob's Burgers, and Mabel from Gravity Falls, not in a flattering way. I pretty much get instantly attacked when I speak, told my voice makes people want to kill themselves, told I should be afk sucking a dick or making a sandwich, and then I get reported. The harassment itself wouldn't be so bad, but I'm in low priority pretty often because of my attempts to warn people of impending ganks / make other calls, and well...   


PLS DONT REPORT ME FOR MY VOICE AHHH :((  I'm really doing my best. If I could trade my vocal cords with literally anybody, I would. I guess the other option is never speak at all, but that sucks. I have hyper-awareness and game sense, and my calls are pretty damn on point. I just don't have time to type everything out in the heat of the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

So like.. mercy, milords. :(  I hate single draft.

DotA2,I have some 400 and 20 IQ ideas to deal with griefers,"If a player have less than 8k behavior score

1- He loses ability to buyback

2- When he buys shadow amulet, and does not move for 10 seconds, he automatically becomes visible again, 

3- he is unable to manually control his courier

4- unable to hold more than 2 neutral items ,1 smoke, 4 sentries and 2 observers at once.

5- Has 2 minute cooldown at selling items

6- Can not drop items to ground, can put them on his courier.

7- He is visibly marked as non pma player, at the end of every game, his teammates have the right to rate his performance,, gameplay, toxicity, passive aggresiveness, self abusive behavior, edginess, if player's if he is calculated to be toxic, he is forced to watch his own replays , each one for minimum of 10 minutes. on top of all other punishments.

8- Can no longer purchase rapier and gem of true sight

DotA2,my little bit on Smurfs,"Was gaming the other day with a five stack, all close irl friends. It's a good feeling to get all the guys together to game, and it's rare that everyone's schedule lines up. We queued into this five stack, which has pretty average legend account ranks, aside from one uncalibrated account. The uncalibrated account absolutely shredded us. The guy played TA hc and absolutely went berserk. At 18 minutes he had blink, bkb, deso, and two wraith bands, full boots and almost a shadowblade. Needless to say it was over quick.

We had fun losing though, made jokes, tried to do stupid things. But the whole enemy stack aside from the smurf was roasting the fuck out of us... calling us bad, excessively tipping us. It just felt so bad. And when we pointed out that they had a smurf on the team it was instant denial and reverting it back to how bad we were.

After the game was over I added the smurf and we talked for a long time. Told him that it's rare my friends and I actually find time during a week to set up a five stack, and get to play together (all of us work fulltime jobs in different timezones). Then I explained how bad it felt, that not only he shredded us, that we got to sit there and listen to his buddies just roast us. And I said these things to him, over and over, but in a way that was actually said with human decency. 

At the end of our 20 minute conversation he was profusely apologizing. Claiming there's no other way to play with his friends elsewise. And then he offered to carry me to Divine 5 (currently D1) lol. I mean regardless fuck this guy, but I knew he felt bad.

Not really sure where I was going with this, but I recommend that if you get smurfed on, add the player, talk with them (with human decency) and let them know how it personally ruined your game/night/weekend.

DotA2,Dota 2 is dying,"I mean, let's face with reality. Dota is dying. Patch releases are taking too long. No innovativity is observed in updates. Let be honest - nowadays Dota still has so much things to implement, to attract more talents and new players, to bring back some kind of attention and respect of old players. Instead - dota is slowly dying. Because Valve doesnt give a fuck about it.

I mean, I will not dig into the all details - we all know what kind of improvements dota development could face. Thousands of topics have been created on reddit on dota developers forum. I think we have around million of pending/raw suggestions from dota community which have been ignored. 

I.g battlecup - What the hell is that? For those who don't know much about it, Battle Cup is a built-in mini tournament in dota, which takes place every Saturday. 8 teams, winner - gets freakin dota plus shards :D:D Thanks Gabe. How about improving a reward system? When battle cup was first invented, people bought battle pass and could win 8-12 levels of battle pass in battle cup. Now - you get freakin useless shards. Reward system - is not only thing to improve. How about making Battle Cup something bigger? Implementing whole leaderboard system where best performing teams shown at? Adding seasons, at the end of which \~top50 teams would've receive certain rewards for contributing in Battle Cup competition? (ofc tighten the smurf system with it)

I'm so pissed off that valve could do much more but instead they're slowly giving up on this game and creating illusion that they're taking care of something. No, Valve - you dont. And those last 1-1.5 years updates/patches and their content is direct proof of you not giving a single fuck about this game. Then announce its development end.

DotA2,Pugna's life drain not buffed by holy locket,"It isn't therefore a heal. HOWEVER, if your teammate is affected by Shivas they will regain less health. I assume this works the same way for Skadi and Spirit vessel but I'm not getting paid to test this. 

HOWEVER HOWEVER, it IS buffed by spell amp. 

[Both Wraith kings were taken to near death at the same time through Radiance. ](https://preview.redd.it/0ttlr268h1y81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01266b0244e14e0fbe82b88e7373f8b71c7b2cc7)

Wraith King on the left side of the screen was healed without the amp from KayaSange, Wraith King on the right side was healed with the amp. Life drain was kept level 1 so it could be used for one full duration without taking either of them to max HP. 

In conclusion, spell amp good on Pugna, Holy Locket not so good but still useful for the item itself. So, Pugna who stood in the back last night healing me but refused to use his Holy Locket charges on me, I dislike you. 

ALSO, spell amp, on Pugna, also increases how much mana you restore to you allies when you siphon mana instead of health. This is NOT affected by Shivas. 

Also can we have numbers which are buffed by heals show their changes when ALT is held down? C'mon guys it's been a couple years already since healing amp came out.",1651923803

Something has been ruining my life recently

Maybe it's ruining yours too

I am obviously talking about spikes in packet loss!! Would anyone much smarter than me have some kind of solution/workaround?

I play on West EU servers, ping around 15ms, packet loss (PL) at 0%, and then suddenly PL increases to 50% and its unplayable, then goes back down then back up. It's usually linked to opponents/team fight.

Configuration: 

* ethernet cable, speedtest gives 100 Mbps
* gaming PC from '15 with i5-6600K 3.5GHZ, 8gb ram and GTX970

I end up having to create a wifi with my phone to have a stable connection

Good afternoon, excuse me in advance for my terrible use of English.

you can tell me Julio and they followed me to create a post on reddit to see if my problem has a solution.

As you can see in the image, I have a very interesting grevil since it turns out that it has the ability to use 4 ethereal gems at the same time.

Two of these gems were set by me several years ago (shortly after Dota2 became free to play). when they traded it to me it came completely clean without gems and it always caught my attention that of the 5 slots with which it came, 4 of them said ethereal as a description, if I had knowledge of what the ethereal gems were (shortly after they gave me el grevil) and decided to buy some gems of little value to test if my suspicions were correct, I was very surprised to discover that the courier did accept them, not so much because he did not know what gems are, but because he knew that it is very strange, almost non-existent that a courier has these characteristics

Now, you may be wondering why I didn't put the missing 2 gems, because very simply I didn't have money, this is where my real problem begins

I had just entered the university, in my country entering the university, specifically a national university, is an achievement to be considered because for the entrance exams there are thousands and there are very few vacancies.

As a result of this income, they gave me money, money that I used to satisfy my only “vice” that had been repressed until that moment for a couple of years because I had dedicated myself entirely to studying to enter the university.

yes, indeed, my ""vice"" was playing dota 2, but not in an uncontrolled way, but on average 2 hours a day (2 games or 3 if I lost very quickly, hahaha), time that was very necessary that I would have to use if I wanted to enter the university so I decided and promised to stop playing until I enter the university (promise I kept after two years of study, which is why I missed 2 battle passes)

With the money they gave me, I recharged my balance on steam through a third party because the 2018 battle pass was already very close (it was not the first time that I recharged through a third party, I had already done it before for a battle pass). battle of 2015 if my memory serves me correctly, the bad thing about recharging was that they charged a very high interest).

After my recharge everything was fine for a couple of days or so, the problem occurs when I log into my account and I get a red banner that says YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT ALERT.

It turns out that the card used by the person who recharged me was a stolen card, which is why I got that ad in red and asking me to contact steam support, which I did immediately because by now, all the powers that any account has, such as receiving or sending gifts, trades, adding friends, recharging money, and other things had been suspended.

At the time the support answered me, they told me that fraudulent activity related to the card was suspected and that was the reason why my account was like this.

I'm close to finishing my career and I really would like to know how long my main account will continue in those conditions (because yes, it's not my only account, because as I said I really wanted to play dota2 and buy the battle pass, which is why I had to create a new account, an account that has all the battle passes from 2018 to the present)

reason why I ask for your help to know what I can do to recover my account since steam support does not tell me when that suspension will last

CURIOUS FACT: After what happened in the account where the greevil is, several accounts added me asking to trade with me offering up to 20 arcana for that grevil, I told them that I would make the trade effective when my account allows it.

After what happened, I created a new one to buy the battle pass, and my surprise was great when, after months, they added several accounts asking for the courier, they even added my friends and family asking for me since I did not answer them the messages.

Sir or gentlemen who have been writing to me for so many years and I did not respond, I apologize for wasting your time, I did not respond out of embarrassment not so much for telling you that my account had restrictions, but rather embarrassment because it reminded me of how naive I had been so many years ago.

To end this post, if someone could guide me on how to recover my account and my beloved items that cost me blood, sweat and tears, I would really appreciate it and if this were the case, I could trade this valuable courier since it is coming soon the new battle pass.

Thank you very much for all those who came to this point and also for those who can help me, blessings.

if you can, share the post, thank you very much again

Julio

psdt: For those who wonder if all this I'm telling you, I also told Steam support. the answer is yes, and i went much more detailed

Any help is welcome",1651902922

I am close to finishing my career and I really would like to know how long my main account will continue in those conditions (because yes, it is not my only account, because as I said I really wanted to play dota2 and buy the battle pass, which is why I had to create a new account, an account that has all the battle passes from 2018 to the present)

reason why I ask for your help to know what I can do to recover my account since steam support does not tell me when that suspension will last

CURIOUS FACT: After what happened in the account where the greevil is, several accounts added me asking to trade with me offering up to 20 arcana for that grevil, I told them that I would make the trade effective when my account allows it.

After what happened, I created a new one to buy the battle pass, and my surprise was great when, after months, they added several accounts asking for the courier, they even added my friends and family asking for me since I did not answer them the messages.

Sir or gentlemen who have been writing to me for so many years and I did not respond, I apologize for wasting your time, I did not respond out of embarrassment not so much for telling you that my account had restrictions, but rather embarrassment because it reminded me of how naive I had been so many years ago.

To end this post, if someone could guide me on how to recover my account and my beloved items that cost me blood, sweat and tears, I would really appreciate it and if this were the case, I could trade this valuable courier since it is coming soon the new battle pass.

Thank you very much for all those who came to this point and also for those who can help me, blessings.

if you can, share the post, thank you very much again

Julio

psdt: For those who wonder if all this I'm telling you, I also told Steam support. the answer is yes, and i went much more detailed

 Any help is welcome

DotA2,Why they need to reset the ranks every once in a while!,"Valve really should reset the Dota 2 ranks more often, and I mean a real reset, not your half assed, play 10 games and calibrate nearly exactly where you were, I mean a real; you need to win 8/10 games to even get to ancient no matter where you were, no bias, maximum variance (for example).

Here are some benefits that I see:

1. less smurfs
2. less ""bad players""
3. more fun!

Here are some of the downsides that I see:

1. immediate frustration with hard earned ranks being lost

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so if everyone's rank just got reset to zero some things would happen:

1. active players may become inactive for a period of time because they are annoyed, arguably this is good for their mental health. when they come back they'll be more positive and full of life (yeah yeah i know..) also if this is a periodic thing, maybe they're less mad because they can mentally prepare themselves for the event, rather than it being a surprise thing
2. active players will be disinclined to smurf. as games for higher ranked players will be very easy at the start, they will have more enjoyment and less difficulty playing than at the highest level, they will have something again to strive for. obviously this doesn't mean smurfs are gone forever, but it will help. also if this is a periodic thing, say every 12 months, then maybe they will have to try a bit harder to get where they want to be on their main account. im sure account boosting and crap will still exist unfortunately.
3. inactive players that play casually (this is where i fall, at around div/anc) will have the opportunity to play again in a less competitive environment at lower ranks, they will still climb probably, but will once again be able to taste the fun of climbing without having to go back to a daily ritual of playing a lot to compete at their level. ie. players who do not feel commited to stay at their desired rank will have the opportunity to find their level again where they will have the most fun.
4. We all know climbing is the funnest part of the game, when we are stuck wefeel trapped and some will begin to vent that into smurfs or toxicity. this can be mitigated by cleaning out the pipes per se. 

Honestly I feel like games are doing this already and Dota is stuck in it's ways. Something like this would be chaotic, but Dota has proven that the chaos is fun. For the sake of the players, CONSIDER THIS!",1651885538

DotA2,I time travelled - Here is Kuroko' fate and Dota's future,"Yes I came from the future. Me and my sweet and sour burrito. Let me give me some spoilers

&amp;#x200B;

KUROKY and TEAM NIGMA

Team Nigma will thrive and win another TI. Yes you read it correctly my beautiful sweaty redditors. But not with their current roster.:

\- Kuro will move to coaching position.

\- A veteran will join as Pos 5.

\- A rising star will be recruited as Pos 1 and carry the team to TI

\- Miracle will be captain.

These adjustments will stop their passive gameplay and move from ""playing not to lose"" to ""playing to win""

&amp;#x200B;

DOTA in 5 years

Dota will trample LOL and become the undisputed MOBA champion. How? By becoming LOL itself.

\- There will be player specific skills - Like the LOL Champion abilities. For example, Teleport scroll is replaced by Teleport skill. Obviously no longer consumable and will have a cooldown that adjusts depending on game time

\- Majority of the new heroes will have anime-ish human race designs. 1 fish race and another flying mythical creature

\- Smurfs will continue to exist

DotA2,Recycling Hero Relics for Shards? - Dota Plus," 

Hi guys,

would you like something like this implemented in the Dota Plus system?  
I've recently changed roles and found myself in a spot where the relics for the heroes I have are obsolete/useless and I lack the shards for getting ones for the heroes I started playing....

In theory if this gets recognition I have a couple suggestions so the shard/relic system doesn't get abused, feel free to add other/improve the current other suggestions

     1. All Hero Relics when recycled delete the current progress of the relic and give back 1/4 of the shards used for buying the relic ( the minimalistic approach )

     2. Hero Relics give shards based on the hero level ( bronze tier gives 5/6 back, grandmaster gives 1/6 back, this could also be switched around so bronze get 1/6 back, grandmaster tier gives 5/6 back )

     3. Same as 2, but based on the hero relic level, XP is taken away from the hero from which you recycle the relic

     4. All Hero Relics can be recycled and you get nothing in return as a radical version of the 1 - we call this the nihilistic one",1651871814

DotA2,Valve wtf ?,,1651845421
DotA2,Dazzle's Aghs still doesnt apply Bad Juju stacks,"According to Dazzle's ult players should get a stack of Bad Juju whenever they are affected by one of Dazzle's skills. This works perfectly fine for Poison Touch, Shallow Grave, Shadow Wave and the active effect of Bad Juju itself. However, the active effect of Good Juju (the one you unlock with Aghs) doesnt. If its not a bug that would be a weird inconsistency considering its very much one of Dazzle's spells. And if it isnt intentional its been bugged since Dazzle's rework in 7.31.",1651844444

DotA2,About farming MIDS,"In the current fast paced meta, as a support how do I win with a MID that wants to farm for 20 mins. I'm not talking Dusa/TA but BoTs rush MIDs who just TP from sidelane to sidelane and farm creepwaves + any nearby camps. I know this playstyle creates some amount of space but what are we, the rest of his team going to do when the strongest hero on our team is spending all his resources to nuke creeps on the edges of the map? Its one thing if he baits the enemy team into chasing him 24/7, but not everyone is dumb enough to do that. Thanks for the help.",1651842209

DotA2,The story of a boy and a fixed 50% winrate. / Part 2,"Months have passed since John has met Yatoro. He still misses the bald guy with the white mask on his face. The way he carried games, the way he avoided ganks, the way he farmed and joined fights at the same time, he can never forget that.

He tried to replicate what Yatoro did many times. But he always had bad teammates. Not like Yatoro. Yatoro always has good teammates, even when he played John's account. Everything was easier for Yatoro. His team stacked for him, pulled for him, warded for him, gave him the best neutral items and they never flamed Yatoro. When John plays, the team is bad, teammates flame and they feed. When Yatoro won 39 out of 40 games on John's account, it was lucky team and enemy had feeders.

Enemy offlaners are so bad when they play vs Yatoro. When John plays safelane, enemy is always a godlike smurf.

These thought gave John peace. He knew that his winrate is not affected by his own skill level. Games are decided by his teammates, enemy smurfs, bad and good drafts. Whatever he does in his game don't matter. The system will force 50% winrate on him. He could sleep well with these thoughts.

Everything was fine for John, he still played Does, flamed his teammates when he was feeling bad about himself. After bad games he would masturbate, but this was a problem now because he couldn't pause the games at start so things got messy from time to time. When he won games, he typed gg ez but he hated himself coz he knew that get got carried. All in all, it was a typical Dota period.

Until one thing happened.

Aliens hijacked (stole) his family. Aliens told him he has to raise his MMR by 2000 points in 3 months, or the whole family would be massacred. The condition was that he has to play on his own account without help during ranked games.

At first, John was shocked. Aliens? Dota MMR? What the actual fuck? - He thought.

It is impossible to raise MMR anyway. There is a forced winrate of 50%. It's impossible to climb MMR anyway. Valve and Gaben made sure of this.

He tried playing his best, but he kept losing because of bad teammates (he thought). He blamed the team, the boosters, the smurfs, everything but himself.

This would have been okay in normal conditions, but the Aliens didn't care about these things. They will masacre his family if he doesn't increase his MMR by 2000 points in 3 months. The conditions were clear.

When he lost 120 MMR that day, he started crying. He wasn't angry. He was scared and helpless.

He kept crying and begging for the help of god. He was lost. The night was silent as death, cold as the heart of my ex, dark as the darkest night.

For a moment he stopped breathing. Someone opened the front door and said:  Привіт брате!  (Hello brother!)

It was the bald guy with the white mask. It was Yatoro. Yes the TI winner. Fucking Yatoro.

Don't ask me how, but he has heard the story, and he was here to help.

He promised John that he will help him to get his family back. John will be coached by Yatoro. He will gain 2120 MMR. (120 that he lost + 2000 Alien MMR).

Now everything was in the hands of our hero,

They started with watching some if his games. Yatoro was writing stuff in this notebook. He wasn't commenting anything yet. They have watched around 10 replays.

Yatoro wrote down around 100 mistakes that he noticed here. He didn't want to go deeper into details, because John would get lost. So he started correcting these 100 mistakes first.

John was shocked. He made mistakes? Wasn't it his team that made him lose? He actually made mistakes? He was baffled.

In the first few days, they played only normal games with Yatoro palying pos5 while John was plasying pos1. John kept learning. This was very hard for him, because Yatoro was teaching him to ignore teammates and focus on himself.

They learned micro positioning in lanes, mana management, courier usage efficiency, optimal starting items and buildups, item choice depending on teammates and opponents, timings, micro and macro decisions, bkb usage, when is it bad to go for bkb, when it it necessary, manta dodging, lane aggro control, map control, playing around vision, playing from behind, playing from the advantage.

It was a long process of 30 days. There were 138 mistakes, 73 suggestions and 130 general tips written down in the notebook. John was amazed. Games became a lot easier. He could anticipate what will happen, he knew how to react in-game and outside of the game. He knew win conditions, he started to play around timings. He knew what opponents want to do so he easily avoided being killed without having impact.

It was time for Yatoro to leave. It was a sad goodbye. John cried and hugged Yatoro. Yatoro hugged him back, took down his mask and kissed John on the forehead.  до побачення брат  (goodbye brother), he said. I gave you everything. Now it's time for you to protect and play for your family.

At this point, Yatoro was a brother to John. He felt that Yatoro leaving is like a piece of his soul ripped from his chest. But John knew that it's his turn now. Piece of shit Aliens, John was ready for the fight.

He went to sleep partially sad, but full of hope.

He woke up with a deadly determination. He shaved his head. He put on a white mask. He was not euphoric. Look the Play button on Steam straight trough the eye. He clicked the Find Match button and just waited there. He didn't alt tab. Didn't masturbate. He was just breathing slowly, clearing his thoughts. Yatoro's notebook was next to him. He touched it with his left hand. He didn't need to read it. He knew every last word.

Confirming Match... Game found... Accept.

His Hard support picked Pudge and said ""i have 7 lose streak idc MMR.""

John just smiled. He picked Drow Ranger and said ""dw i got this"".

He finished the game with 12/3 and a victory.

Out of the next 500 games, he has won 287 games and lost 213.

The moment he gained the last needed MMR, the sky oppened and the Aliens brought back his family.

Someone added him on steam and wrote a message:

""I'm proud""

Then the misterious strange went online.

From that day, John never played without the white mask.

DotA2,"Reporting smurfs, by filing as terror threats?","Has anyone been doing this? If you see a smurf, open their steam profile and file a report and say they are smurfing but also say they may be engaged in terror threats and that valve could be in legal trouble if this message is ignored.

  
That way they legally HAVE to investigate, and at the very least ban them for smurfing.",1651841178
DotA2,Anti-smurf queue by number of games played?,"Can we have a queue mode where it filters by numbers of games played with a maximum per rank?

ie; In herald you can only filter minimum games played up to 500\~

In crusader its up to 2000

In Archon 3000

In Legend 4000

In Ancient onwards its maximum of 5000?

&amp;#x200B;

So how this would work is, you have a slider bar you CAN set it to 0. (ie; how matchmaking works now).. OR if you move the slider, you can slide UP TO X where X is your current mmr rank.

If the slider is set to 3500 for example, The you will ONLY be matched against people with over 3500 games.",1651841041

DotA2,1.7k MMR furion. looking to improve.," 

I have started playing furion a few month back and I enjoy the Hero and his dynamic in the game.  
I am really having a hard time with my winrate : 33 % over 30+ games.

The playstyle is a bit new to me as I used to play tanky offlaner (centaur / underlord / bb / tide). I am looking to get better at the game in general by playing a different type of offlaner.

I am looking for a more experienced player to help me point out the main mistake I make in the game.

Some of the game ID :

[6548283514](https://stratz.com/matches/6548283514)

[6546568482](https://stratz.com/matches/6546568482)

[6546178486](https://stratz.com/matches/6546178486)

You can look any other match on my profile

Right now some pointers i am feeling :

* I don't have enough impact when I tp in fight
* I am taking too much space from my carry / mid without really creating much
* furion is really easy to counter with bots.
* my mechanics are weak especially in 1v1.
* my lanning stage is ok. but I feel I am not denying as much as I could (mechanics again)
* i am not really clear what to do after the T1 are taken but we are still to weak to take T2 / Rosh. (Farm dangerous place and def tower ?)

DotA2,"""Its just unranked"" is toxic and here's why."," This is one of the worst excuses/reasons ever to actively grief any game in any mode period.

Now when I say griefing, I don't mean trying new builds or missing skill shots or doing a strange lane match up that isn't meta. All of these things are fine, and if someone flames you over them then they are toxic and should be told off/muted.

I'm talking about when you're in a game and someone on your team asks you, ""Hey could you build this specific item, because we need it to win and you're the only one that could build it and without it we will lose."" and you don't because, you want to play the game your way. (Note on this, I'm not talking about trying a different item build, I mean like if you're the pos 1 and you don't have a bkb and your team asks you to build one so you don't explode in a fight and you choose not to because ""its not fun for you"") Or if a teammate asks you to please join them in team fights and not afk farm as the pos 5 because without you it's impossible to win any fight simply because they are down a man.

So many people seem to forget that Dota is a team game, ranked, unranked, turbo, AD it truly doesn't matter what mode it is. Other people put time and effort when they get on to play and you as a player getting on and building first item Midas on a pos 5 ogre when your entire team is behind and desperately needs a force staff or glimmer asap doesn't do anything productive. It's not toxicity that your team gets angry with you for being selfish and unhelpful. And you responding to them with ""its just unranked bro, why do you care"" does nothing but inform them that you are someone they never want to play with ever again because no matter what you are going to do things your own way regardless. YOU are then the toxic person, you are the one costing the other four people on your team precious time and pleasure that they get on this game for.

Similarly responding to someone with ""if you want to try go play ranked"" is just a different way of saying this same line. You don't go out with your friends and play baseball and when you already have a pitcher, you decide ""Oh I want to go play pitcher too"" So you just stand on the mound with the other person and if anyone complains say ""its doesn't matter, we aren't playing for a trophy/in a competition"" You know why, because none of your friends would ever play with you again because its toxic shitty behavior. There's no difference because its online vs offline. You wouldn't act that way in real life because you would get a negative reaction and people only act this way online because there's no accountability. It doesn't change that it's still horribly toxic behavior.

TLDR: If you ever or have ever said the words ""its just unranked"" you're a toxic person and should re-evaluate how you treat others that you interact with.",1651802917

I played 10 ranked games a year ago and lost every single one of them having done 0 research about changes to the meta and hero's. Even after 10 losses I still got ranked into legend. Kept losing a very steady amount of games then platau'd into crusader &amp; have remained there more or less for a year; I made it to archon like 3 times but each re-calibration I tried ended with me losing more games than I was able to win

But honestly, in low ranked games, WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF? yet again, WHO WOULD WANT TO TRY THIS EXPERIMENT? In low ranked, most players picked core heroes for support role, and often don't play according to the roles while ruining the chance to win games for other people who want to seriously carry. (Hard support riki/huskar are the common examples) 

I'm not asking this to be implemented for the entire players, just in LOW RANKED games, so that the game can be more enjoyable for the noobs out here who want to get better.

DotA2,Why are some heroes picked every game while we never see other heroes.,"There are many heroes which are evergreen in DOTA 2  especially in the pro scene.

Heroes which are probably not even in the minds of any drafter in pro teams.  I cant think of any other hero right now except Cystal Maiden for instance. DO you think there is some problem in the hero design? Do you think it is fair that heroes like this have no way that they can be useful in any pro team? I find it extremely sad that while spirit brothers are picked almost every game while no one ever picks Crystal Maiden let alone contest its pick.",1651788081

DotA2,Dear Valve: How about including more variables in the MMR algorithm?,"Right now MMR basically takes the outcome of a game and applies the corresponding change of rating to your account. This means, that even if you played out of your mind beyond your skill level you will still go down.

Over time, this works perfectly the well, on average better players will win more games than worse players. 

However, because of the massive amounts of MMR abuse, as well as the long duration of games, it takes a lifetime to gain or lose MMR.

What about including other variables in the calculation and making a more appropriate snapshot of skill rating? This way, account buyers would be de-ranked much faster, and people at the bottom (who are improving) could rise quicker in the ranks until they start hitting their ceiling.

The obvious stats are KDR, GPM, etc (based on role, of course) but also things like APM, reaction speed, item choices (as compared to the top players in that same scenario), and others could play a role. Maybe there could even be an overwatch-type system of ""promotion"" if someone is clearly way better than their rank.

Is there some downside to this that perhaps I haven't considered? Is the current MMR system fine as is?",1651783013

DotA2,Craziest game I've played,"I never post here but I just can't get this one game off my mind, this is after nearly 2k hours of gameplay. I wanted to share, brag, complain, suggest based on what ended up being one of the craziest game I played last night.

It started with everyone putting markers in the lanes. I went safelane and so did my lane partner. He picked sniper and thus ensued the chat on what his intentions are. He said repeatedly that he was a ""position 4"" (I know it's doesn't make sense for safelane) sniper when I asked if I should go support. After he insisted again, I picked wraith king because I felt that I'd get really good ranged harass to last hit and and could use the stun to supplement the weakness of a sniper support if they went on us.

We end up getting dumpstered in the lane in exactly the way you'd think a support sniper would get owned. The warlock/dawnbreaker combo just deeply shut down this sniper, who was sitting behind me. He kept pushing the lane with his shrapnel instead of harassing with right clicks and was out of position sitting behind me so the warlock just kept casting w on him. He never pulled to compensate for his shrapnel and was thus more exposed as a result of his actions. As soon as the little regen he bought was exhausted, the dawn then came in aggressively and forced us both out of the lane. It became clear he was not attempting to support but to ""dual carry"" by taking some last hits, spending very little on support items, and waiting for me to leave so he could take solo xp and farm.

When I went in for a last hit I'd lose half my life, even with my E skilled to guarantee the last hit. I decided to jungle at level 3 and let the sniper have the lane. It was miserable, you need at least 4-5 levels to be a viable jungler as WK and for the first 10-15 mins I was lagging the entire team in levels by a significant amount. The other team was ganking heavily and our mid lion and pos 4 CM were caught on their back foot.

Sniper decided that this was his chance to be the carry he said he wasn't going to be and started building damage items. They were constantly chasing me around the jungle and I was barely gaining levels.

I managed to still get a pretty fast radiance after the op team made a strategic mistake and abandoned the lane they ""won"" and went with a farm centric build (maybe a mistake given early game?) and switch to a utility/tank WK instead of my normal damage build. I built A/C faster than normal for defense/survivability, built Sange into Yasha instead of damage items and then upgraded to overwhelming blink for lockdown and stats. The opp disable and slow heavy build (warlock, dawnbreaker, winter wyvern, CK) was locking things down hard and the warlock would just double rock me whenever I showed up to fights and team fighting was just really hard even with one of the most survivable players in the game.

We eventually started to win some fights with good positioning but were still on the back foot. The sniper was doing well because I changed to utility and could lock down their back line with a ton of survivability when I took focus. Whenever we had the advantage, we'd do something stupid though; sniper would run up to their tier 3 and get picked off and I did the same when I thought my team was going in. They eventually regrouped and managed to push to tier 4s and take them down.

Then, we won the fight as they were hitting our ancient. They had used all their spells and we bought back and killed them all, almost losing when the catapaults kept hitting ancient while we were chasing down their last player. We drove up mid and had a 5v2, killed them as they respawned, and ended the game just as they were all respawning. It was the closest game I've been a part of and felt so much better because of everything that happened early.

Takeaways:

* People spend way too much time experimenting with setups in pubs these days. We had three ""experimental"" roles at the same time but it's literally every game for me now. It usually fails in exactly the ways you expect and it just ruins the game for everyone
* People grief in ways that are actually self-reinforcing. The sniper felt like he was the hero and will probably be motivated to build like this again, despite the fact that he was only rescued by the fact that others happened to have done the opposite and could switch from core to support easily. In the post-game, he had muted everyone and gotten at least four griefing reports and still was saying ""I bet you're glad I built damage items now""
* It feels amazing to turn a game around and itemize well situationally. I'm just getting to the point where I don't build 75% the same items no matter what the game and while I probably could've done better (maybe a bkb instead of sange?) it still felt good to be able to swap into a completely different build than I thought I'd be doing and see it work out.
* People don't play well when they are losing. It took so much of my effort to convince our team to not fight and run away even if it meant losing one player. They kept trying to teamfight and run at somebody instead of split pushing and hitting towers to force rotations and take initiative.
* Never give up! Even in the worst of circumstances you're facing either a tough opp lineup that falls off, people can make mistakes that equalize, and at least in the lower MMR nobody punishes as much as they should so you can catch up and split push much more effectively if you know how to play from behind.
* Party queueing is so much more common now than it used to be and it's annoying for a solo-queuer. On one hand it's nice that the game is becoming more social, but it really locks out people who aren't in parties. Often the parties are in a discord and don't comm with the rest of the team and they also just decide to lane together and lock out the rest of the team. Sniper was not in the three stack on our team and neither was I. However, it blocked our ability to lane swap when things went badly and he was complaining the three stack was ragging on him because they were paired. While this does happen to me and I empathize, it didn't actually apply; he was actually griefing. It also creates way more variation in skill leading to bad matchmaking. I'd like a strict solo for pubs.

There. It's off my chest. Dota 2 is a great game, but because it relies on teamwork often with strangers can be so frustrating some times. When you can overcome despite the odds it makes it all worthwhile, but it's so much more fun when you don't have to overcome and can just hit a good stride with a team and the only challenge is the skill and draft of the opps, not the forced errors on your own team's skill and draft.

DotA2,Neutral items should have a 6th obtainable consumable for the team on several tiers.,"I think that interesting consumables are an untapped part of Dota that allow you to make cool effects that only function a single time in a game

Consumables in neutrals can function as creatable structures, creeps or even spell scrolls. Some examples could be:

* A buildable tower that does not provide vision or fire attacks unless entered by a hero.
* A strong creep to add to a push that adds a bit extra tower damage to finish off a t1/t2 still standing after 30 minutes. Maybe like a ranged and melee unit combo?
* A water spirit that spawns strong water runes but only summonable in the river, several times over 30 seconds. It can be killable but the enemy could also stun you and contest the runes to gain the advantage for themselves.
* A tunnel shovel that lets you create a tunnel, similar to underlord, crossing a distance or passing through unpassable terrain, that can be destroyed by enemies but is usable until destroyed. Maybe have it disable in roshan walls.
* A [lure, similar to age of mythology](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Lure), that attracts jungle creatures to spawn more frequently, stack twice as many, or spawn occasionally at the lure.
* An elemental book of disasters, able to cast a natural disaster in a location after a channel, such as an earthquake, a tidal wave (oops we already have this), a tornado, a Volcanic eruption, a dust storm (reduces vision in the area).
* A spy tag. A usable tag on an enemy that does not show up on their debuff bar that grants vision like an old bounty hunter/slardar ult, however is removed upon dispel, maybe only lasts 30s or a minute or so.
* A Tree trap, a visible rope on the ground next to a tree that if walked on, holds an enemy upside down until they kill the trap with auto attacks. Allies can help, similar to Grimstroke phantom or Weaver bugs, but a trap instead.

I personally am not a good enough player to say whether or not power rune would be okay to return, same with mango tree, but they were quite fun. I loved having a mango tree.

Since only one could be obtainable per tier (to prevent item bloat), you could possibly make it so you can either choose a defensive, offensive or even utility consumable from a small shop selection.

These are just ideas off the top of my head over about 20 minutes, I think that its an underutilized area that can make dota more fun. Let me know your ideas, or criticism of mine. ^^^^^please ^^^^^be ^^^^^gentle",1651769071

While it seems pretty straight-forward on first glance, this causes some spells to not interrupt her ult anymore once she buys shard.

1. Taunts

Berserker's call, Life Break (shard), and Winter's Curse (with CM as the attacker) no longer interrupt CM's shard ult. Interestingly, Duel still interrupts.

2. Instant Displacements

Glimpse, Nether Swap, and X marks the spot interrupt CM's unupgraded ult, but don't interrupt her shard ult.

3. Overgrowth

The way Overgrowth works is that it forces the opponent to do a stop command. Since CM's shard ult doesn't get interrupted by stop command, it doesn't get interrupted by Overgrowth.

DotA2,Valve official position on mouse macros?,"So i have a razer deathadder, and i just realised it has the neat ability to create and bind macros to single mouse button clicks.

One thing I got into the habit of doing recently is double tapping f1-through to f5 to see where my allies are at.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly enough I think it's more convient for me to cycle f1-f5 to get a good idea of where my allies are RATHER than glance at the minimap (oddly enough).. I suppose it also gives info on what my allies are doing, if they need a tp, and what their items are like/ what their mana is like, what their cooldowns are like.

&amp;#x200B;

So if im playing mid or something, I can quickly tap f1-f5  and figure out who can help me gank and which lane to rotate to.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the question. I realised i can record a macro that cycles through f1-f5 on a single middle mouse click, infact one better.. It double tapps each one of those, so the map flickers for a second as it jumps between every hero with just long enough to get an idea of whats going on with them.

Isn’t it the same hope that makes you want to wish you get 21 in blackjack, or slots, or spin wheels. I think gambling companies are feeding on our addiction to hope and it’s our responsibility to not promote things we do behind closed doors.

DotA2,How Valve devs screwed up Underlord.,"I think they make his damage per tick rather than per second. A mistake when trying to fix shard that was bugged.

I believe I confirmed this in demo. 

- Dummy Target has 5620 HP.
- Firestorm is 1% max-damage/sec (ignoring fixed).
- At level 1 firestorm, does ~1300 DPS.
- If Dota is 30-tick game, this lines up after 25% magic resistance of dummy.

Again: Someone did the maths wrong and did it **PER-TICK** rather than **PER-SECOND**. Easy fix.

You lose almost all of your HP in about **10 second** if both Bloodrage and Blood Mist is active AND while receiving no damage from enemy. This is just stupid and in late games it just make him die faster. To be really able to sustain the damage from Scepter upgrade, he needs a pipe and Bloodstone which just takes two slots late game and makes him less of a carry. So, the scepter upgrade seems really useless, in fact more harmful to a carry seeker late game.  
Also, another important point is that, enemy can counter his Blood Mist damage with BKBs, while he still receives the self damage from Blood Mist on BKB. This is again bad late game, where in fight most enemy will have BKBs and just make his skill useless and but useful to enemy as seeker is just loosing HP much faster.  


Either Seeker needs a new scepter, or this scepter needs rework.  
Suggestion - Scepter deals half damage to seeker. Deals no damage to seeker if BKB is on. Increases life steal from Spell to 30% while on... Something like that.  


Valve please look into this as Scepter on Dota seems to be made for enemy team to make carry seeker just die faster late games.",1651708443

DotA2,Can someone please explain how Valve releases new hero sets?,"Hi all,

I recently found out about the Steam Community Market and am interested in understanding how it interacts with the Dota2 store in their client. My previous experience with client transactions is with League, but there's no secondary market where people can trade skins. I am specifically interested in how marketable items work.

How does Valve originally release their new marketable items? Do they sell them themselves via the store in the client? Or, are they only released through lootboxes/battlepasses and then allowed to be resold on the market following these unlocks? When I look at the in-client store, the links to buy directly all seem to be to the Community Market.

Sorry if these questions are super basic. I feel like I have been looking for a definitive answer all day, and I still can't find one. Any help is appreciated. Last note: I am somewhat aware of the Dota Plus pass, but I'm more curious about all marketable items (and these appear to be exclusive), and not necessarily those you get through Dota Plus.

The problem is that Valve only ques him with low lvl accounts like his, so his que time is 15min or more every time. He just wants to save some pa players with relocate but he can't cuz of the huge que times.

I’m not saying Gaben watches over you and makes you lose/win games eventually leading you to a 50% wr, rather that other things rather than MMR get considered when searching for a game and teammates and the more you win the more the games tries to stop you from advancing forward to keep balance in the ranking system, however if it fails you get considered as a much more skillful player and it let’s go for a while usually awarding you with a new in-game rank before it starts the same process to find your true place in the system.",1651700464

DotA2,Is the answer for Dota's performance issues actually larger CPU caches?,"So patches after patches, average FPS keeps going down and although the Spring Cleaning update helps, it's still absurd how hard to hit 144+ consistently is. After seeing hard-to-find benchmarks for Dota on the new 5800X3D CPU ([[1]](https://youtu.be/EQqSJfJ1TOw?t=68), [[2]](https://youtu.be/Z8Ru0gmOfQc?t=264), both by the same guy) though, I find it's interesting how huge the difference was.  

The only factor that's different on the 5800X3D  which I could think of is its huge cache, as the number-crunching power compared to the 12th-gen Intel CPUs should not be that different. Which is also weird that Dota has RTS roots and most other RTS and MOBAs run equally faster on the 12900K or sometimes even faster (e.g. StarCraft 2, tested by HardwareUnboxed).

Another problem is like in some games that i lose enemies like on 3 cores buy mass bkbs and all pop bkbs and jump my team, our carry is still farming his manta instead and we lose like this 3 fights in a row and myt carry cant even get to bkb in time anymore. I havent incorporated stacking in my game btw nor rotating for rune, does that have much impact in the game? it feels like if i lose my off alone he will just die and i dont gain much from leaving.

DotA2,7.31 is just terrible,"7.30 was, for me at least, one of the best patches in Dota history (been playing since Dota 1). Except for a few outliers, the patch was pretty damn well balanced, and it was so much fun (at least in pleb Divine bracket). Used to play 5-6 hours a day during 7.30.

7.31 on the other hand... it's not just that it's poorly balanced. Every patch will have better and worse heroes. It's that the heroes that are good right now are just so . incredibly . boring. Death prophet has 98% pick+ban rate in pro games or some ridiculous shit like that, and it's just a very monotonous hero. Play style and game plan is he same every game. Same for Necrophos. We also have Tiny which you'll see every game and is just widely accepted as broken.

On the opposite end of balance, we have shit like Bloodseeker's new Aghs, which was probably an out-of-season April fool's joke. I feel like there hasn't been this high of a disparity between what's good and what's bad in a long ass time. Just look at Tiny, and then look back at Sven.

DotA2,The story of a boy and a fixed 50% winrate.,"Once upon a time, there was a boy. His name was John and he was 24 years old. John was your average Dota 2 player with a total playtime of around 5000 hours. Just like the average player, his MMR was also stuck in the same place in the last few years. John believed in forced winrate. When he would win a games in a nice streak and gained some nice MMR (+300), he would slowly lose that MMR.

John usually didn't notice when he won games because the enemy team had feeders and ruiners. But he would be very emotional when had gotten bad teammates. He would usually explain that he is stuck in MMR because of these bad teammates. He never told about free MMR which he gained because of bad enemies.

John was your average player, he would sit down to play in the morning. Only for one game before studying. Sometimes he would win that game, and he thought that it's a good day for Dota and he can climb MMR today. Sometimes it was really a good day for Dota, so he kept playing all day. He would win a lot of games, end up with nice KDA. He felt good about himself. Easy +3300 MMR.

The following day, he played his morning game and he lost it. He was angry, he wanted his MMR back. And so he lost all the MMR that he has gained the day before. Easy - 300 MMR.

Then John mad a screenshot and made a thread on Reddit about the forced winrate.

John is 4000 MMR for 3 years straight now.

The story goes on.

John was sad and frustrated. He wanted to dominate. So he bought a Herald account for 20 Euros.

It was nice at start. He had a 85% winrate overall. (He didn't ask himself, why is the forced 50% winrate gone). Soon, he ranked up to Guardian, then to Crusader, then to Archon.

His winrate wasn't 85% winrate. As he got better enemies in Archon rank, his winrate was slowly dropping. It was about 65%. He ranked up to Legend. He was now very close to his MMR on his main account which is 4000.

A few days after, there he was on 4000 MMR. 

One strange thing happened. He was on 50% winrate again. **The awful and cursed 50% winrate.** He knew that the whole world is conspiring against him. 

He was 100% sure that Gaben sits in his office chair and is laughing about John. He knew that he is a victim of 50% forced winrate.

He went to sleep angry and frustrated. He hated everything. The bad teammates especially.

When he woke up the following day, he couldn't believe his eyes. It was Yatoro sitting in front of his PC. Yes, you read it correctly. YATORO. The TI Winner.

Yatoro told John, that he needs to sit next to him and watch.

So Yatoro did what he does best. Out of the next 20 games, he won all of them. John's account gained 950 MMR (15x30 for 15 wins, then 5x100 for being in smurf pool).

John didn't understand how is it possible. It must have been bad enemies and good teammates. There is no way Yatoro is winning because he is actually better. It can't be. 

John asked Yatoro to play 20 more games. Yatoro listened and won 19 out of them. It seemed so easy. Like a knife cutting butter. Almost as if Yatoros right clicks were stronger than Johns.

When they went to sleep, Yatoro was gone. There was no sign of him anywhere. John has hoped that Yatoro settings are still on John's PC. But everything was set up for John to play.

Yatoro gained around 2000 MMR in 2 days on Johns account, and John was now a 6000 MMR player. 

The rest of the story is simple. John has lost 38 out of 40 games on carry position. He was back to 4000 MMR.

**The truth is, Gaben has a secret camera in every home. When you win a lot of games, Gaben will match you with bad teammates and good opponents.** 

**Don't believe in anything else. Yatoro won 40 games (and TI) because the system is rigged. He is not actually better than you are.** 

**John, if you are reading this, don't believe anyone who is trying to suggest anything else than what you believe.**

**When boosters win 20 or 40 games on your account (while you can't), it's external factors. Valve simply gives the boosters bot to play against and always give them good teammates.**

DotA2,21/22 DPC Tour 2 Division 1 - Caster and event feedback thread,"Hey r/Dota2,

Over the last few months we've made the rules a bit more strict when it comes to event shoutout and complaint threads, requiring them to have some tangible and constructive feedback. We will keep things less strict when it comes to less familiar faces in the scene who don't yet have the exposure. We are trying to create a more healthy interaction between the subreddit and the English talent scene, as we weren't very pleased with both the way that feeback was presented, as well as the tangible but volatile effect these threads had on people's careers.

The plan is to have these threads for LAN events and at the end of online leagues such as the DPC tours. The next one will be posted after the Major.

With that said, please share whatever feedback and thoughts you have on the coverage of the just concluded DPC season. To refresh your memory, here is a list of the on-screen talent for each region:

DotA2,Matchmaking Ban,"So here’s the deal.

I played Dota before, I calibrated Guardian and was stuck on that tier which is as toxic as it gets.

Therefore I created a new account (which is not against steam rules) and started playing in hopes of calibrating higher.

When you open Dota 2, the game actually asks if you’ve played Dota before and I selected that option. All good so far. Played two games, won one, lost the second.

Yesterday I decided to invest some money in this account and put £25 in my wallet, bought some items from the Dota store (not the market).

Then it started happening. I noticed that I am waiting for way too long to find a game so I messaged steam support and got the following reply:

“ Hello,

Thank you for writing to us. 

Upon checking, this account is restricted from matchmaking in Dota 2.

A pattern of behavior was observed on the account that was detrimental to the Dota 2 community. The following are examples of behavior that may result in a match ban. This account may have exhibited one or more of these:

- A consistent pattern of user reports, negative conduct, and behavior
- Smurfing
- Deliberate actions to artificially boost MMR of an account
- Buying, selling, or trading accounts
- Creating an unfair competitive advantage through third-party programs
- Manipulation of matchmaking or match outcomes

These actions undermine the fair, competitive play experience of the Dota 2 community. Steam Support will not lift this account restriction. 

Steam Support”

None of the above apply and I checked steam and there is no VAC ban applied. When telling the support agent that this is incorrect, they’ve just replied that they will close the ticket since they can’t lift the ban.

I’m very annoyed since not only am I banned incorrectly but I just invested some money into this account which I cannot use and they won’t refund.

Can someone tell me how I can fix this or get my money back?

Steam support is not very transparent nor helpful.",1651661741

DotA2,Who else here completes Wraith Bands at 25 minutes?,"I normally start with 2 circlets on most agility carries, then at the 25 min mark, if I haven't replaced them yet or soon to, I spend the extra 700 gold to get the 2 wraith bands.

That's 8 armor, 16 AGI, 20 attackspeed, 4 STR, 4 INT. All for just 700 gold. Yes it delays another item, but this is a big power spike that might be worth.

Not sure if it has same value with Bracers or Nulls, since the heroes that buy those need the completed item early. For Agility heroes, wraith bands early seems bad but for the value 25 min spike, it seems good.",1651654355

DotA2,AU/SEA region captains mode community! ( Herald to Archon bracket)," Hey new/low rank players of AU/SEA region

I’m have set up a discord community for new/lower rank players (herald – archon) that want to play 5v5 captains mode scrims(approx 60 members so far). Specifically, I think this is a great place for new players to come and learn against actual other new players than trying to navigate unranked matchmaking that usually doesn’t go well. 

We have an in-house comp starting very shortly (teams 2k mmr average) and would love to see a few more people get involved!

Discord invite link: [https://discord.gg/sDdTzYkVbM](https://discord.gg/sDdTzYkVbM)

A few things to note:

\- Based in AU/SEA server

\- Entry to discord requires some basic info to be posted in a quarantine channel (rank, behaviour score, why you want to join) to ensure that we are getting quality members in.

\- I get the entry requirement is annoying, but it will be approved quickly so don’t be too stressed about it.

\-finally there is some catering to players higher than this mmr as coaches/pubs but there is a mmr cap on the organised comps!

Any other questions you can reply here or in the discord.

Thanks for considering and hope to see some of you in there soon!",1651652781

Savage Roar is a spell for escape and disabling. The current shard upgrade is kind of not very helping in situations where you are losing and want to break from tight situations. It can be modified to make it more useful for its basic utility.

DotA2,Theory on what happened to Mene.,"I'm sure, I am not the only who noticed Selemene being called the Usurper?

Then I realised it makes absolute since once you look at the history of the Moon Goddess.

Selemene is given the title of Usuper because she was never the original Moon Goddess. She stole the title from another, most likely her Twin sister.

How did she do this? With the help of the Invoker.

In one of the episodes, the Invoker says something along the lines of, ""I have killed a god once.""
Coupled with the fact that he wanted to Frymyn to kill Selemene in order to become the new Moon Goddess means this isn't the 1st time. I mean, he wouldn't urge Mene to do that unless he knew exactly how to take the divine spark within Selemene and give it to Frymyn.

My theory is that, once upon a time. Mene was the Moon Goddess, but Selemene with the help of the Invoker killed her and took her powers.

Some Elves bowed down and worshiped her, while others left.

This is why we see certain elves still worshipping Mene.

I mean, even the Invoker mentions that throughout all those centuries of Elves worshipping Mene, their love took shape in the form of Frymyn. That's why she has powers, because she is possible the reincarnation of Mene.",1651606238

DotA2,Ukrainian caster V1lat is now calling out Russian FSB to investigate against VP players and stuff,"
https://twitter.com/v1lat/status/1520357357632593921

&gt;Player VP, Pure supported the Russian Army and the special operation, expressed his position to the whole world on the air. His club forced him to publicly apologize for this, and the next day he fired him for supporting the actions of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. Did I correctly understand the actions of the Virtus pro club? If I understand correctly what they have been writing about for the last two months, then this is a discrediting of the actions of the Russian Army. Starting from the overwriting of the symbol, and ending with the dismissal of a Russian player who publicly supported the army. This should be the subject of an investigation by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation and the FSB.

So let me get this straight, after the Z incident with Pure he cried out that entire VP squad shall be banned from Dota scene along with Pure. Now that this is accomplished, he is trying to bring Russian authorities attention to the fact that VP stuff apologized for it and DM tried to conceal the Z symbol (in Russia you now can go to jail for that). He does this in order to fuck up VP from ‘each side’ apparently.

DotA2,Been playing Dota since the WC3 days. I never felt Dota was so stale to this day,"I'm quitting Dota for now. In all this years of playing, I think this is the time where I feel Dota is more stale than ever. Even back in the old WC3 days, where big patchs were unfrequent, you had something to look forward to in the future.

As of today, this is not the case for Dota 2. Last patch was the longest a Dota patch was played, and despite that, the new patch was whole lot of nothing burger. Just some tweaks to the neutrals that'd been the same forever (just changing spots).

And unfortunately, there's nothing to look forward to, zero, nada. No big gameplay changes, no taking care of years old bugs, broken cosmetics, broken report and commend system that makes you play with 0/18 Hard Support Spectre in a 10k behaivor score game. And if you happen to be in low brackets, dear lord, good luck with the smurfs plaguing all matches.

&amp;#x200B;

The yearly compendium that derailed from being a celebration of the game, to be a competition for whales (where arcanas costed $40 and free to buy for anyone but now are under a FOMO $400 timed paywall) just doesn't make it for me anymore. We get to a point where having some brilliant and shinny hats (that probably will be broken in a few months) doesn't make the Dota 2 experience any better.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the ""beta"" or ""free to play game"" memes, we have to be honest here, and Dota 2 is in maintenance mode right now. Maybe there are two active people working on gameplay stuff, that gets released once every 2 or 3 years with some little patchs in betweern. And a handful of guys making cosmetics non-stop for the 3-5 months that the Compendium Fever lasts.

From what i heard they were not that known and did not have much expore before like EG for exampe or Secret, etc. Were DC for example like the current Gaimin Gladiators who mesh well together and were kinda unkown? Also i heard Wings is probably one of the best dota2 teams to ever play. Why? Cause after TI6 i heard they also disappeared.

What if these 5 players teamed up together to create the dream team and make a run at TI? Do you think they'll make a good run at TI through the open qualifiers? I personally think Nigma should disband. Miracle and GH are wasting their time and talent on that team. Topson recently said he's ready to get back to the pro scene if the conditions are right (hinting that he needs to have teammates that he can trust). Although he mentioned skipping this TI, I'm pretty sure if the opportunity presents itself, he will consider joining a good team. Ceb is still one of the best pos 3 players out there and N0tail still has what it takes to be a captain of the team. What are your thoughts?",1651587122

And yet &gt;99% of the playerbase plays outside of the the competitive ladder.

- Hero releases only after TI

- New patch (no matter how big or small) is probably gonna be released after the next major, and everybody keeps facing broken heroes till then

I understand that tinkering with things before either quals or playoffs of a major will greatly affect strategies and outcomes, but whatever happened to communicating patchnotes a week in advance before they become active on the main game? It was done in the 6.8X patches I think its a perfectly fine move to make smaller balance changes along with a 7 day notice. This will help teams know what to expect moving forward and also make updates consistent for the larger playerbase.",1651570642

DotA2,Dota2 Obsever Analyze by BusyLiving,"Hi, this is BusyLiving. Recently I found a brilliant idea of creating a Dota2 minimap by using Source Film Maker. The method is detailly explained by Devilesk on [http://devilesk.com/dota2](http://devilesk.com/dota2), which I want to appreciate.

&amp;#x200B;

So today we have a project about observer wards. Rather than using unprecise, misleading, trash minimap in the game, we have reliable, high-quality minimap of the thumbnail. In the project, I parsed over 300 high MMR ranked replays from ceb, topson, sccc, and paparazzi gaming records, so the games are combined with Europe, SEA, and China servers. I tried to distinguish between the servers but the result can't tell much difference. However, since the samples are great like never before, I believe the analysis is pretty reliable and informative. 

&amp;#x200B;

The project is designed and exported to be pngs to become friendly to mobile users. In case needed, the project is also updated to Tableau Public:

[https://public.tableau.com/views/wardanalyse/ObsAnalyze?:language=zh-CN&amp;publish=yes&amp;:display\_count=n&amp;:origin=viz\_share\_link](https://public.tableau.com/views/wardanalyse/ObsAnalyze?:language=zh-CN&amp;publish=yes&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you all can enjoy the project and don't forget to share your opinion in the post.

But wait, since I wasn’t playing during 2019, I will NEVER be able to get the item. I get making scarcity to influence people to buy the BP but at some point, why not just put these kind of items on the store a couple years (2-3) after the battle pass ends. Give those who got the item the exclusivity for a while, then let those who couldn’t/didn’t get the item get themselves. 

Maybe I am just bitter for not having it and/or deeply underestimating the number of whales who spend $$$ to instantly get things like the Drow Arcana (from what I found it was about $140 from level 0), but that translates to roughly 4 people buying an Arcana on the store ($35). I am willing to bet the overlap between people who spend that kind of money to get it instantly and the people who would wait 2-3 years to buy it to be low.

Dont even make it tradeable/marketable! Literally make it so the only place to get those items is the store. If you really want to keep the scarcity going, make it a rotating store like other games have.",1651551743

5. Most important for me personally: quickcast on key up option is turned on by players only in order to be able to hold-aim-unhold. For non-target and toggle abillities it only adds interfering delay. So we need QC on key down behavior for these abilities (like some QC on key up behavior for QC on key down in last spring cleaning update, but vice versa).

Some suggestion useful for new players:

1. Add note to passives that are not disabled by break (like tiny-grow or wk-reincarnation).

Matches just aren't close - nearly always a stomp.,1651531358

DotA2,The problem with Mind Games seeding in EEU DPC S2,"Since the following contains spoilers, prelimenary disclaimer:  


&gt;!Mind Games are currently playing the finals for the 3rd major slot in the S2 of EEU DPC. However, they only won one series, lost two more series 0:2 and only got in the finals by the seeding and getting matched up versus Outsiders who got DQed. This means they got 2 default, free wins. Their overall score is 2:5 before the final matchup, while teams like Navi won more series and more games (out one round earlier) or CIS Rejects, who also won significantly more games and matches, only to be in the exact same position.!&lt;

&gt;!Why did MG get both default wins? Why was the seeding not adjusted, so the matchup wouldn't be repeated like this? Seems awful, since they are a significantly worse team and got significantly further than they should just based on two free wins. It's not only about the major, as I'm fairly certain CIS Rejects are going there anyways, so the ""rightful"" 3 teams end up going. It's also about DPC points and money.

DotA2,Casting with a back injury,"So thought this would be a fun story for you guys. 


It looked like this https://twitter.com/hairy_freak/status/1521178181281193986?t=yigsI1lVYA2Y7JwZcHsZVA&amp;s=19


This weekend i went to Novi Sad to cast a Charity Cup organized by BetFury and Lvlup. I pinched a nerve in my lower back at the gym, causing excruciating and debilitating pain to say the least. 


Spent the two days there literally unable to move and Buktop(lvlup owner) and Boranija(the Serbian pro player) having to help me move, didn't need to carry me, but when i needed to move for whatever reason I would put almost my entire bodyweight on them and then slowly go towards my goal xD. 


Luckily there in the lvlup bootcamp that I was casting from there is a couch and the bathroom is very close so didn't have to move much. 


There were no other casters so I had to do it, I promised I would, so we found a comfortable enough position in the chair and I did my job till the end which I am proud off. 


Since I couldn't at the time put any preassure on my lower back cause of the pain for and until we figured out how to set me up I casted standing literally supporting my weight with the hands that I put on the table and my feet almost dangling. Was funny and scary for the people around me but we are dota players even if you cut of our hands and feet we will find a way to enjoy/work on our favourite game.


So many cool stories and memories from those two days obviously can't write all of it but just wanted you guys to get an idea of how it possibly looked like from my perspective.


For those that care I am better now, still hurts a bit but I can move, the fear of the pain is kind of keeping me from moving freely and I believe I should stay in a vertical position for the next couple of days. A guy looked at my back and told me why it happened. Since I didn't make any nasty moves in the gym and have had some problems in the past but it never hurt like this. The therapist told me what the underlying issue is, and once I am healed I can work on it so it doesn't happen again.



Would like to thank the whole lvlup staff and Boranija for every bit of help and believe me I needed a ton of it. Cheers everyone and stay healthy.


TLDR; Pinched a nerve in my lower back but had to cast a tournament. Wasn't pleasant, but I survived and healing now!",1651514488

DotA2,Major Clinkz bug/exploit: Death Pact + an infinite Tornados,"I've just played a game against a Clinkz where he somehow made 4 or 5 of the Wildwing tornados appear permanently on mid lane. It meant the **entire lane would never push because these tornados would just kill the wave** which is absolutely broken beyond belief.

Looking back at the replay the way he did it was he took the lvl 15 talent to steal creep abilities, would use it to get the Tornado ability from one of the small raptors and then time it so he would be channelling it as the death pact buff expires. This way, it would continue channelling indefinitely with (presumably) no way to cancel it. 

The max channel time is meant to be 15 seconds and requires a channel, but this bypasses both of these so it has to be a bug. It should go without saying that this is unbelievably fucking busted and really needs to be hotfixed.

Just wanna say I fucking love Axe so much man.
Such a fun hero. Always fighting. Can fit in almost any role and just always wants to fuck shit up.

Nothing better than catching a 3 man call and guillotineing all their heads. Legit might be one of the most iconic moves in dota.

Also add the fact that one of the most iconic monents in dota history happenened with Axe.

DotA2,Game winning/losing bug with Grimstrokes Phantom's Embrace vs. Puck (Jaunt and Phase Shift),"Hi! I just wanna share this game I played yesterday with a party Match ID: 6550499660. I haven't been able to replicate the bug, but what happens is Grim tries to cast Phantom's Embrace to Puck and he Dodges the W with his Jaunt and Shift. It ends up stalling the ghost in place and providing vision on Puck (Until Puck dies, or if the ghost is killed) similar to how track and Slardar ult works. We can see him through the fog and knew he was tp'ing. It happened again in the mid-game but with lesser impact. Though I can imagine how game ruining this for some other games.",1651461752

As an Ancient player of the longest time and peaked Divine 5, I remember the euphoria of achieving the Divine rank back when you need to have 5k MMR. It had a certain weight to it. I would brag it to my friends like I won the lottery. A badge of honor.

DotA2,Old dota thoughts,"last night i was play with my homie (both divine 4 - 5 ) and we remember Dota 2 in his early stage (both get a key in mid 2012) Just laughing for the ""good old days"" but.. (maybe it was my experience) when i remember clearly, old Dota 2 was shit, (i was 3k - 4k in that time, pretty high mmr) in all games was some random dude dying in jungle, 5 dudes feeding and laghting/rage about it and 2 or 3 dudes playing pretty bad but not at feeding levels, not to mention the servers were crashing a lot and the toxic behavior was worst (curriers feeding and items missing and destroying)

Maybe I remember it as ""the good old days"" because at the time I didn't know how to play it right and when I fuck up, I really don't know what happened and I just laugh,  the skill difference was to much and the mechanics skill made a really advantage different back then

so, old Dota in restrospective was pretty bad compared to actual Dota.  may the actual dota feels more boring bc we all know the basic mechanics, its not like jump in a new experience anymore like old days but in overall experience, the old Dota was a bad game (Dota always, at least for me, was better moba experience in general compared to the others, i'm just compared the same game in different periods)",1651444553

DotA2,What are the differences between a PRO level dota player and a PUB player in the same MMR bracket?,"More often than I have experienced, while watching stream, that pro players flame regular pub players for being a bit lose or slow in the decision making department. Sometimes people call each other out on the basis of their current ranks. e.g., a rank 200 player will easily flame a rank 600 player. 

As a general viewer and not as an expert, I humbly want to know that what are the differences between a dota pro and a pub player even if they are in the same MMR bracket? Is it something mechanical or mental or knowledge based or practice based?

DotA2,Is it even worth going for kills on the enemy mid unless low risk?,Been practicing and getting coached alot recently. Been often encouraged to be more aggressive during the earlier stages of the game. But recently in one of my Huskar games I found myself dead to the enemy SK mid who should have no shot at killing me because I got overzealous and he hit 4 while I  was about to kill him and he stunned me to death. I did overall win the lane hard due to the very unfavourable matchup. However I believe this may be a sign that I shouldn't be going so hard for these kills? I mean I don't even have to necessarily kill them to win the lane and snowball out of control. So sign that I should slow my roll or just unfortunate circumstance?,1651440953

DotA2,AU/SEA region discord community,"Hey AU/SEA Dota community,

I’m starting up a discord community for mostly new or lower rank players (herald – legend) that want to play inhouse 5v5 captain's mode and 5 man party queues. Higher ranks are also allowed but subject to the players who are organising the games since this could cause imbalanced games. We will also try to organise stacks for the weekly battlecups

I also think this will be a great place for new players to learn and find people who are friendly to teach them stuff about Dota. For the more seasoned players we will run as many inhouse games as possible to engage in some more organised games that will require teamwork.

Discord invite link: https://discord.gg/qt7A3ZPvSG

Some things to consider:

- Our server is based in AU/SEA server, so most games will be played on these two servers.

- Entry to Discord requires some basic info to be posted in a verification channel such as preferred region and role, rank, behaviour score, the reason you want to join.

- Verification process won't take long, so it won't be much of a hassle.


Any other questions you can reply here or in Discord.

Thanks for considering and hope to see you there soon!",1651397531

8 months in and it moved up in the world. +10 dps at lvl 15. Huskar was still pathetic.

A year later, it was buffed again. +15 dps at lvl 15. Huskar was reworked.

https://preview.redd.it/rfu7x8mzdtw81.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ed9a9044f0c5fec30a3dcc14c0a0cc783f3f4e5

But good things never last. They soon realized mistakes were made. Huskar was too strong. Nerfed back to +10 dps at lvl 15.

https://preview.redd.it/rg3lopb1etw81.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ae07935e121a65ca907c354fdfaa5c268a54f44

Another year, and then they nerfed it some more.  +8 dps at lvl 15.

https://preview.redd.it/fxwi9p04etw81.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=999ce0f9ed1ec5a53cfe94ed98e444807e853c82

And then they nerfed it still.  +6 dps at lvl 15. (This was when every talent in the game was nerfed)

2. Gain some regen while invis (hp and mana)
3. Gain some status resist while invis (could encourage people to take more risks while using invis rune because they are less likely to feed if they walk under a sentry ward)
4. Gain some hp while invis (similar to 3)

DotA2,A message to Virtus Pro and VP save.,"In the slimmest of chance that my message reaches the desired audience, I'd like to start by saying that i am a fan of dota and i want the best for dota. I consider VP to be a good team it's best for dota if all the top teams are competing together. 

With that being said, there are only two scenarios I can fathom,

1.) You have absolutely no remorse for your actions and you just want to avoid the consequences and move on.

2.) You did it because of some sick humor and now you sincerely regret your decision and understand the reasons behind why it is wrong.

If you fall into the first bucket, i think the punishment is not sincere enough! Valve showed you leniency. I think there should be addition fine on the org which should have been donated to Ukraine along with full year ban for VP and 5 year ban for save. Grow up, learn how to respect other human beings and then think about playing with international teams.

If you fall into the 2nd category, how about you learn to say sorry. Own your mistake and apologise for your actions. I understand you are in Putin controlled Russiaa nd a Putin controlled org but till now there hasn't been even a half hearted attempt at apology. It almost seems like you have no remorse for your actions but just disappointment from it's consequences. You can say something along the terms of, ""Dota is no place for world politics and i deeply regret my decision. It was wrong of me to draw ""Z"" on the minimap and bring politics into dota, and for that i am sorry. I also want to request valve to consider letting VP compete and not punish them for my mistake. It was my mistake and my mistake alone. This ban on me is just and I will take this time off to reflect upon my mistakes. I want peace and a swift end to this war.""

And VP should do the same, apologise! Instead of running away from their actions. Own your mistake!
Say sorry and teach your ""kid"" to say sorry before you pull out the ""18 year old kid"" card. A public statement where you apologise for saves actions since they were under your name, clarify that the views of save don't reflect the views of VP as an org. 

To me it is really unfortunate that this happened but it's about time that ""18 year old kids"" learn the concept of ""consequences"" even if their parents, thier orgs, their country and their teachers failed to teach them this along with basic respect for humans!

#peace",1651344768
DotA2,Watching the EEU DPC chat shows why Valve needs to take action on that specific region,"I was watching the EEU DPC games and it's honestly sickening how ""people"" are behaving in chat.

Showing their support in chat for current events and so on. People searching every way possible to write that letter from eZ to Zai to Zzzz, most just being stupid and trying to be edgy, probably.

The Pure incident. It's a pretty cut and clear case imho.

Other sporting events/organizations have taken action against this:

In Chess, you are not allowed to play under the russian flag. Karjakin who supported the war explicitly was banned and removed from Candidates tournament. 

Tennis, banned both Belarus and Russian federations. Rugby, the same

Football, banned teams from international play in UEFA Cup and Champions League.

Formula 1 terminated it's contract with Russian Grand Prix and teams.

I recently got married, and my wife's younger brother has a large interest Dota 2 and enjoys it quite a bit, so I was wondering if there was any resources to help as I've been told the game wasn't very beginner friendly, as I wish to play the game with him so we can bond more.

His English isn't the best (he's Filipino) and my Tagalog is very basic, so he has a hard time teaching me. Like I said before, I have previous Moba experience, but Dota 2 seems to be a very mechanically unique compared to most and has an extreme learning curve. 

I am sure this topic comes up a lot here, but I do not know anyone who plays it and a lot of guides I see seem to be outdated due to added or removed changes. Thank you in advance.",1651340039

DotA2,[UNPOPULAR OPINION] Valve Should Totally Ignore This Subreddit Regarding Discipline Matters.,"1- In past Valve always whenever possible banned players who committed the bad conduct, not teams. further in this case something more happened, 3 other players reacted non positively to their team mate in SECONDS

2- We have a 4 million dollar tournament hosted by Saudis who are trying to starve 40 million people to death in yemen and also comitting all imaginable crimes, they are  more brutal than in any other war ever occured in world in last 40 years. And many teams participating in it because saudi crimes dont matter, because it does not get media coverage due to completely political reasons, and they contribute to game with Money.

3- There is actually mistreating of Russian athletes, musicians and even for some reason book authors who got nothing to do with war, I do back ukraine but not fascists accross globe, example many subreddit users bashing DM for his English over trying to understand his simple point. If you are going to come and argue BUH THEY MUST KNOW, half this subreddit consists of NA players and ; Their country  still believe saudis are good guy, it is okay to genocide and starve people in yemen, in past they believed They were doing iraq a favour  ( still in war!) And libya has been freed from a dictator. ,and here in Turkey around 9 years ago my country's president Erdogan was presented to you as secular muslim democratic reformer, some of you even believe a murderer cult leader is an islamic democratic scholar.

4- Simply speaking; Americans are unselfaware , Subreddit has similiar opinion to people who support Putin. Which is scary, in such enviroments, stupid actions are more likely to be taken. 

War is a terrible thing and it is completely unacceptable to use war symbols while Ukraine a country of 40 million people suffering for totally political and dirty reasons of Russia and few other countries. And so does Yemen, and in Dota2, this international game i think BTS made an American decision and decided to sanction all 5 players, hope Valve judges this like any other case,because it is . If your problem is virtus pro owner being oligarch, they are far nicer people than Royal family of Saudi arabia, please go circle jerk with your bullshit opinion while watching your own media. You are as brainwashed as some Russians are.",1651336497
DotA2,Valve did wrong on disqualifying the entire Outsider roster,"The other 4 players shouldn't pay for Pure's error.

Let the other 4 players get a standin and try their (probably deserved) place at the major.",1651336478
DotA2,it genuinely hurts seeing the state of Dota right now,"I'm generally a pretty optimistic person and have thoroughly enjoyed playing Dota for these 8+ years. 

However, Valve's mismanagement of the game over the past year or so is downright depressing as someone who is passionate about the beauty of the game.

There are bugs galore. Several Meta heroes are good BECAUSE of these bugs. It does NOT feel good to lose because of this. It doesn't feel like you're playing this beautiful and super complicated version of chess - more so that you just lost to developer laziness. It takes you out of the game completely. I swear every time I open this sub there's some new shitty bug. Nightstalker can eat your allies' fucking couriers? Are you kidding me? 

Every single game is a combo of 5-10 completely obnoxious heroes. The meta has been insanely stale for almost a year at this point.

DPC has some serious format issues. Remember Valve completely mishandling the Major back in February? Hearing Sumail imply that it would be better for Dota to die than continue like this was so sad. 

True Sight is months late. 

Smurfs and account buyers destroy game quality all over the place, especially in high Divine / low to mid immortal.

Seeing a game that has so much beauty and potential get zero upkeep, marketing or basic PR just hurts so bad. ESPECIALLY when this game pays tens of millions to its pro players annually. It's completely ridiculous and unacceptable. The future that Dota COULD have if it got some basic TLC is so exciting. 

Imagine if Dota had a good pipeline for integrating new players. They could hire charismatic top 1000 players to create in-game instruction that gives them a solid Dota foundation - particularly with regards to strategy. Stop matching new players against players / parties with thousands of hours. Crack down on smurfs and griefers. 

Imagine if Dota had frequent updates to keep the game polished and keep people excited about the game. Frequently fix bugs, improve performance and introduce new events. 

For the love of God make Dota + a good experience.

Imagine if Dota had actual marketing - you know, like other multi billion dollar ips? Hire content creators to produce content about upcoming features, heroes and changes. Developer livestreams. Highlights reels for the DPC. Regular ranked and DPC seasons with content to celebrate new seasons of each. Hero spotlights. 

So much potential there. I hope we get that version of Dota instead of a slow descent into the grave",1651336153

deadalus ＝ cannon/blizzard cannon
eaglesong ＝bow
orb of corrosion＝ big orb of venom

ring of health＝

they call it like this，875，also know as 5 Health Regeneration，priced at 825，effect is 6.5 Health Regeneration

hand of midas＝support hand /team hand
boots of travel＝ support shoes/team shoes
radiance＝support blade/team blade/team evasion
dagon ＝ red scepter/support scepter/team scepter 
I asked one of my Chinese friend，he just saied，The best way to support your teammates is kill all enemies.

falcon blade ＝ cheating money blade
/Dogs don't even need it.

kaya/yasha/sange＝single blade
kaya and yasha / kaya and sange / yasha and sange ＝ double blades

eye of skadi＝ ice eye 
Here's such a story. Chinese players often call wards eyes. Then, once in the game, someone said that we needed eyes（wards）, and his soft support teammate bought an eye of skadi.

Urn of shadows＝cinerary casket/emperor
Spirit vessel ＝ big cinerary casket

There is an interesting story about the origin of the name Emperor.One day, old chicken（EHOME）was playing DOTA2 live and met topson.An audience said that if you give topson cinerary casket, I would send you the emperor.（emperor，a way to reward.The price is RMB 150,000.It is also equivalent to $22,695.）So old chicken gave topson two cinerary caskets.So after this, CN DOTA2 players call cinerary casket emperor.
At the same time, Chinese players use it to attack noob teammates. When they are about to lose the game, they will sell all their items, buy a cinerary casket，give it to their teammates and say that this is your family's cinerary casket. They will also buy branches to make themselves/storage/carrier/have no spare place to make sure they won't send it back.",1651334864

DotA2,"About v1lat, CIS dota 2 caster and host, who is a fascist and shouldn't be allowed to any Valve event.","Hello Dota community. Today I want to talk about one particular dota 2 caster and active member of our community - v1lat.  
He is widely known in our community, at least in CIS. But he is a fascist and here is why.

Almost 9 years ago in 2014, he commented on a CIS cybersport website that on ukranian incident in Odessa, where on may the 2nd about 50 ukranians were scorched by molotovs by other ukranian citizens. The burned people were against maidan, so v1lat let himself say this: ""what happened that day there? kebab day? I love may the 2nd, kebab smell all over!"" So he was happy that 50 of his fellow countryman with other political opinion were just burned to death. He is happy about it and the first one to comment about it. I will attach the printscreened comment under the post.  


Long ago, during an official game of DOTA 1 he had an argument with his viewer live where he got really mad and said the following things: ""No, friend, I'm not confessing, you're just a fucking m\*ddle, I f\*cked your mother, f\*cked your sister, broke their heads with bricks, fucking shit, threw them off the balcony, turned them over, f\*cked them again, then f\*cked your father in the \*ss, then ordered your father to f\*ck to f\*ck your sister in the \*ss, and you, f\*cking f\*\*got, ordered to watch it all, and then eat sh\*t, all the shit all your fucking relatives produced, go f\*ck yourself"" Video in the comments.

Another incident happened the day when Ceb said that all russians are third-world country pigs and you probably know the rest. V1lat agreed with ceb, also saying that when you have 2 braindead russians in your team no wonder you would want to say such thing. He also pointed out that an average russian player is a toxic imbecil, who only ruins games.

Then there are also recent occasions v1lat showed himself as a complete fascist. After some events happened between Russia and Ukraine, he tweeted several fascist things which are he hates every russian, I am a TRUE russophobe, every one of you should burn in hell. You are a russian? Go fuck yourself russian. 

You may or may not know but he owns Maincast - ukranian cybersports organisation, which often casts tournaments. They are against the war, and this is a good thing, BUT at the same time they collect donations for VSU to buy weapons and other military things like vests or ammo, which is ALSO prolongs the war and doesn't let this conflict to end.   


I am deeply concerned that this person is still allowed to be on Dota scene and even cast many official events, promoting the prolongation of the ongoing conflict every other minute during their livestreams.

DotA2,Dungeons and Dragons and Dota,"So a group of friends I meet up with for stuff like board games and the like have really been itching to run a D&amp;D campaign for a while but none of the other guys have been too down to DM. I finally fell on the sword, so to speak and offered to run the campaign. Instantly one of the guys lights up and starts spewing out these huge desires for this campaign to be epic and run till lvl 20 and them to be bad asses and gods and suddenly I feel like a shrinking violet, daunted by these expectations to create such a grand story. I started to doubt myself and really rack my brain about how I was gonna pull this off.

Then, like a guy having Steven King novels thrown at him, it hit me. Dota. Dota has such a rich, wide world, with upwards of 123 unique characters whom I know like the back of my hand and my party has absolutely no knowledge of. For me, I'll just be retelling my favorite matches and describing my favorite heroes/sets. For them, it will be a wholly unique and imaginative world. I've already told them I'm cribbing the idea, so they know it isn't my original idea. But they're all fine in the ""If I haven't seen it, it's new to me"" line of thinking. 

Mr. Excited wanted to be a traditional brooding swordsman monster hunter. I showed him a picture of DK and a picture of Juggernaut. He gravitated towards DK so I was like 'cool' and then he started talking about wanting to have a wolf or a dragon motif and I just smiled inwardly and let him believe he was really writing this idea. Said he didn't know if he wanted a familiar or a mount or something like that. I told him don't worry about it, I'll take care of him. (I suppose if he has a last minute change of heart he just switches from DK to Lycan)

I had another player who wants to be a drunk paladin with a polearm. I showed him Mars and Brewmaster. He loved Brewmaster and said, yeah, he was thinking of someone like Friar Tuck from Robin Hood (the animated Disney version) so I'm like 'alright, great. He's already cool with being a furry. Nice.' Another guy wanted to be a sneaky elf rogue who was nobleborn. I'm like boom - Riki. (but I offered him Bloodseeker, just for the illusion of choice) 

So, overall, I think this is going swimmingly. I'm thinking about having CK be my biggest bad because, well, I love CK and any excuse to play him - even as a GM in a D&amp;D setting - sounds like a blast. I was planning on run ins with Kunka and Tidehunter, Bounty Hunter being on their trail. CM and Lina being opposed quest givers. 

And the abilities! I know it's going to break a lot of mechanics but I could hardly care as the flavor is going to just be Chef's kiss. I was thinking about homebrewing them as feats - Brewmaster's cinder brew, Riki's blink strike \[it's basically fae step\] and, what will probably be to DK's delight - Elder Dragon Form ... okay. That last one might need some major overhauls. 

So... what're y'all's take on the idea? Like I said - I know a lot of the abilities will be unbalanced for something slower like TTRPGs and I don't yet have ideas for all 123 heroes (like Dark Sear might be real, real minor) but I think it might be a fun campaign.",1651329479

When I was 14 I've got my first cell phone. Me and my cousin were messing around with it and our teenage brains didn't come up with anything better then text something stupid to a random number. We typed in ""c\*nt"" and my couised asked me to tell him a random phone number. My ingenious brain decided to go with my mom's number (I had it memorized, I used to call her from stationary phones by dialing in the number). I couldn've stopped at any point. I couldn't have possible gained anything from this. But my brais still went through with it. 10 seconds later my mom storms into my room and gives both of our asses a giant whooping.  
I'm telling you this story not to excuse Pure (his action is inexcusible and the punishment is well placed) but to answer the question ""how DUMB do you need to be to do that"". You just need to be a kid. The point of the story is to remind us all that we all were very stupid kids once. Let's be grateful we managed to grow up without any Pure-level fuck ups.",1651323197

DotA2,"[PSA] People who believe they should be friendly to everyone. Even intentional griefers who are ruining everyone else's game, including their own, are contributing to people losing hope in the game even though they're trying to do the opposite.","I'm gonna get downvoted so hard for this but fuck it...

Stop playing the moral high ground game, or acting like people who call out griefing are creating a toxic environment. report griefers instead of acting like everything is fine. 

Optimism is good but defending and being friendly to pieces of shit intentionally ruining everyone's game is not really a smart thing to do, especially since the person calling out the griefing is probably the one who's most affected by it. And when they see that nobody cares that they're being griefed, they will lose the will to play and either announce that they're going to waste time until the game ends or do it silently.  


YES. THAT MISERABLE PERSON IS ME. And here i thought that I was gonna play dota and actually have ONE good game. I carried griefers for SIX games in a row. I won all of them but didn't enjoy a single one.  


Of course, I'm furious, for six games in a row I HARD CARRY griefers at 9k behavior (I'm not 10k because I had to abandon due to an emergency recently). I do usually manage to win with griefers but none of those games are ever fun.

I truly do believe that griefers like that should be bullied out of playing dota until they quit. Is it toxic? YES. Is there any other way to reason with them instead of making them quit? NO. Because those narcissistic shits have ZERO regard for anyone's time or enjoyment. So please don't ever bother yourself or try to be friendly and defend them because they give NO SHITS about you. The only reason they aren't griefing YOU is because their narcissistic selves enjoy having someone talk for them.

Stop reporting and bullying new players, we need new players to keep the game going, and it's not their fault that they are bad, they're learning. Report and bully griefers instead, those fucks know how the game works but choose to intentionally ruin others' games for no reason. 

To end the vent... I REALLY appreciate friendly and optimistic players. You guys make the game 10x better when you're on my team (even if on the enemies' team as well usually). But for fuck's sake, don't defend griefers simply because you want to be friendly, not everyone deserves that friendly treatment, when you defend a griefer you're really hurting someone else in the team who was just trying to have fun before they got griefed, griefing is against ToS and it's in the report menu for a reason, so use that to make the community a better place.

Then we force hg push. A couple of failed attempts that resulted in our team getting wiped. Then their pos 1 comes-back and wins. 

How do I prevent this. What are some general advice on forcing hg? 

Thanks.",1651231999
DotA2,Im sick and tired of people in my bracket abandoning games for the tiniest things and I get punished for it.,"Context, I just played a game where my safelane abandons the game because the hard supp didnt babysit him. Whats worse is I was doing very good mid and he abandons at minute 10. So it is almost impossible to win the game unless the other lanes were dominating at the start (which they werent).

This is solo queue so fights among random teammates are common. But it pisses me off to no ends when I get punished for the stupid actions of others. If they abandon, we teammates cant leave without getting a mmr malus. So valve wants us to keep playing a game thats obviously lost and in short waste our time. Is it just me or isnt that just unfair? Like if i dont know the guy and he abandons cant I just not lose mmr if i lose a very uneven game? If the person who abandons is in your party then yes ofc you should get the mmr malus since you could exploit it.

Idk if my rant makes sense. Im just tired of trying my best just to have a troll ruin everything. Lemme know your thoughts.",1651231757

I don't like to macrocontrol the game, but when I make the calls often turn out to be right and change the game or fight, and in low ranked it's really hard to comunicate with your teammates.   
My main pos are 4 and 5 but I can't found a way to carry my team in this positions, only playing super-aggro hero.

I enjoy the game, I don't think mechanically I'm the worse because I tend to play mid against 1k immortals when I party. I'll admit I don't think I'll ever hit immortal because I never put the time and effort to learn new things anymore nor about the meta.

DotA2,"Fellow spammers, why do you spam your hero?","I've been playing DotA since the Warcraft 3 days, and yet my hero versatility forever hovers around zero. Why? Because I just love Visage. Out of around 1,000 matches ever played, I have 434 matches played with him alone, with an unexceptional all-time winrate of 48.8%. My next most-played heroes then tail off sharply (270 matches on Io, then down into the double-digits).

I keep picking Visage for a few reasons:

* He's obscure, so he never gets banned;
* He has a huge skill ceiling;
* He can be played in a number of positions (some ill-advisedly);
* Few at Archon understand how he works, so you can catch people out, especially with his shard and scepter;
* He really tests your micro, and you can feel like a god when you execute that legendary chain-stun whilst coordinating up to 6 slots of active items.

Quite honestly, I think he's the finest character in DotA. My main misgiving is that he can feel a bit unimpactful (in the late-game, or up against certain drafts) for how much skill he takes to play.

How about you? What possesses you to spam a hero, if not Visage?",1651222589

Nature's Grasp is ok, but it's hard to keep enemies in it for long enough that the damage scaling makes a huge difference. Living Armor is ok for patching up your towers, but it's only 6 HP/s regen at max level. Why are they prioritized so heavily over Leech Seed?",1651216363

DotA2,Requesting Magnus Tips,"Hello all,

Not trying to get serious and rank up or anything but I enjoy playing Magnus.

Anyone got some tips for Magnus play?

So far things I know about Mag:

1. Mana boots or Reg Boots (If we have mana regen on our team like KOTL or CM)
2. Blink + Shard almost right away after boots. Are there situations where I should get something else first like a team aura item?
3. BKB somewhere in there unless they have 0 disables
4. Blink + Ulti = Turn magnus so I can skewer them in the direction I want instead having to walk around them or do the Shard skill (goddamn forgot the name)
5. Scepter - I honestly don't know when this is worth it. I'd rather get armor or survival shit.
6. I try to wait for battle to start and hide in the trees or off enemy vision until they group like 3+. Sometimes I RP even though 1 out of the 3 are BKB'd and don't skewer them. Sometimes I wait til their bkb runs out but I realized sometimes you just gotta rp them because then it's too late.
7. I hardly get Refresher Orb but supposedly OP.
8. I hate heroes with long range stuff like rubick (puts my blink on cooldown from a mile away. io and those stupid things.) For them I try to get smoked up and surprise them or get Silver edge (should I ever be getting silver edge? I only get silver edge when they have long range heroes that can cooldown my blink from miles away)
9. The only thing that can stop me while bkb'd is like ""pudge ulti, blackhole, major physical dmg, legion dual, damn dazzle, etc...)
10. Can RP literally get EVERYONE?! Anyone bkb'd, lifestealer's RAGE mode, can it get Elder titan's Bkb mode thingy?
11. If I have nullifer and someone cyclone's themselves and I RP, would it get them?

&amp;#x200B;

Frequent Items I get

* Mana or reg Boots
* Blink
* Shard
* BKB
* Shivas
* Assault C
* Heart or Crimson  or Pipe - depending on the enemy
* If more time, then lotus, scepter, upgrade blink, moon shard?

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips and tricks for Magnus would be much appreciated. I like this hero. :)",1651187314

Also in general, please try to speak less authoritatively, yesterday too you made several incorrect comments - like when you said Spirit didn't have any heal reduction/urn/vessel, when in fact Hoodwink had a vessel.

Just 1 spirit lance on a support right before the teamfight, and those two were running back to base, the the rest of the team faced a 3v5... I felt bad for them really

And on lvl 4 Thunder Strike deals only 110 damage.

It is also his only skill that deals any damage in early game.

PS: exclusive immortals = axe's unleased, lion's Hell-Spar Anathema, kunka's Prize of the Saltworn Mariner, lc's Legacy of the Fallen Legion, tiny's prestige is kinda immortal.

DotA2,Bring Back Necronomicon,"Its a cool niche item that became not so niche, so volvo just removed it. Necronomicon being too desirable might be the reason, so imo we could just make it less desirable for heroes who usually don't build Necro.

Here are some possible tweaks:

* Necronomicon starts with 0 summon charges and gains charges when an enemy hero dies nearby (like urn). After using a charge Necronomicon goes on CD and if through items or abilities the item CD gets refreshed or lowered, using the Necronomicon again while the existing summons are still alive will still expend a charge but will only relocate the current summons to the location of the caster. The idea is to discourage spamming Necrobook to Rat and Deward  as well as to make CD reduction and Refresher inefficient on Necronomicon.
* Necronomicon Warrior Passive True sight is now an active ability with 24 second CD. The active ability allows the Necronomicon Warrior to see all invisible units and wards nearby for 12 seconds. This to nerf Necro Warrior's ""free"" gem, since it provides truesight over a large area with little risk to the caster which feels broken compared to other sources of true sight where there are clearly drawbacks.
* This part is probably bullsh\*t but here goes. Instead of 2 sages masks Necronomicon buildup could include costlier and trashier small items like 2 robes of magi +  2 belts of strength + recipe. The idea is to discourage casual Necrobooks since not a lot of heroes want 2 robes each with matching belts similar to how Nullifier buildup sucks.",1651157859

DotA2,How to hit immortal? Struggling on div 4 like forever.,"I have over 15k hours. I have played lots of lan tournaments, have good mechanical skills. Played with 3 digits teammates and opponents as pos 1, have won as well. But when it comes to solo q, I just can't hit that divine 5 and immortal mark. Always struggling between divine 1 and 4. I can't spam heros because I just feel bored or lose the "" fun "" after losing 1-2 games. I have watched lots of BSj Videos and Gamerz class and when I am watching those, I am familiar with mostly all of the mechanics. I know what they are saying very clearly. But in Solo q, I just cannot use them or idk what it is. Is it the auto pilot? I'm not trying to sound over confident or anything like that, but as per playing lans and winning to those high rank teams, I at least consider my self to be 6k mmr player no cap! I'm totally different person when it comes to lan ( team game ) vs solo pubs. I have tried so much but I can't just hit that immortal rank whether it is due to my auto pilot and bad gameplay or just having 1-2 griefers in games when Im actually in the zone ( still I don't care about that because it will happen. I just want to be better myself ). I have lots of notes as pos 1 and pos 2, what things to do, and all that stuffs. But when it comes to game, I just go auto pilot maybe but I cannot focus on those things. Even if I do, it's only few things and gone. I'd really love some suggestions on auto pilot and actually being able to hit that immortal rank.",1651152802

3. Is there any plug ins i should install for a better viewer experience?

4. Does background music help?

5. Would streaming everyday be better than streaming every other day?

6. Lastly, does speaking out strategies in my mind or what im doing would make the stream engaging?

DotA2,Welcome to SEA dota! (advice from topson),,1651128747
DotA2,Quitting Dota till valve fixes shit.,"Started playing dota after some time as I thought would be fun. But, it is even worse now. I just played a game where we were owning our lane. Our lane was am and cm and they had sk and pb.And enemy pb at lvl 3 started dealing 500 dmg and killing us. I was ahead of enemy offlaner by 1k at min 5, and pb as pos 4 started soloing me as sk usually didnt have any mana coz of the harass I and cm were doing. Your definitely tilted that a lane you have won so hard can be lost to a hero with just boots at who is under levelled than you, but, whatever, you still try. So, I had a drow last pick mid who lost to a lion whose starting items were windlace, ring of regen and tangoes. Drow was losing from the start to lion, however, he started blaming ogre when puj rotated mid to kill him. Well, I didnt care that he lost lane, the annoying thing was he never tped in a single fight. All he did was go mid, go nc, get killed by Lion and repeat. After a while, I told him to tp when they dive, and he said ogre didnt tp when puj ganked thats why I lost lane. Every gank that would happen he would never tp, he had the same thing to say that ogre didnt help me mid when Puj ganked thats why I lost lane. He was 0 5 1 at around 25 or 30 min when they were diving us and running way at low hp. And drow didnt tp even once. Some time later, he started saying where is your farm carry am, when he hardly joined any fights and was taking all the safe farm. The only one who took Drows side was our ES who said just play the game. But, once they started taking racks and Drow kept dying solo on other side of map, even he started to tilt on this drow. When they were taking throne, Drow kept saying how he destroyed lion in lane, but lost coz of Puj. But, when our team checked the garphs, he was losing to lion from the very start. And somehow he was ancient 3. 

I will start playing dota again when the next patch comes which nerfs the stupid Primal Beast and also makes changes to ranked. I used to divine 5, but lost most of it due to poor internet connection during covid as I had to relocate. I thought it would be easy to climb back, but as it turns out the variance of skill in ancient is so much. Like, almost 80% players are good the remaining 20% decide whether you get +30 or -30.

DotA2,Rubick aghs should be able to switch between stolen spell slots,"Rubick aghs is super fun. 

My only issue is that it reminds me old invoker, where if you wanted to keep your oldest spell you had to recast it and ""invoke"" would go on cooldown. After valve Changes this mechanic invoker became much more fun to play imo. 

My suggestion is to make double tap on spell steal switch between spells, so you could decide which spell you wish to keep. For balancing it could make spell steal go on cooldown, so that you could not do that mid team fight.

For some reason i am thinking about Hoodwink Bushwack should connect with Treant Protector or Prophet's treant might be an interesting feature gameplay.

Icefrog really doing his best ideas with DotA's gameplay changes with Neutral Items, New Neutral creeps etc. , but imagine that DotA having a different cycle? For example :

1. Having another day/night shift adding rain or snow (for some heroes like zeus/razor with electrical power will get a slightly buff or features and snow for heroes like Crystal Maiden having a small buffs for her skills or atributtes)
2. New important creature like Roshan but having another purpose (like dropping a unique Neutral Items once only for killing that creature) Remember Repair kit?
3. Adding another Gods Heroes (Greek, Nord, Egypt, Chinese, etc.)

Or maybe there is another heroes that can have unique feature as well? Write it down your most interesting fantasy about this game.

DotA2,(Maybe) Unpopular Opinion: They Should Bring Back Clinkz's Burning Army as an Ult Rather than Death Pact.,"Death Pact doesn't feel like an ultimate skill for me. I'm not talking about which skill is the most effective one, I'm talking about game design. Literally just eat a creep and gain some of their HP and damage, sounds like a very underwhelming ult. Compared to Burning Army which is flashy and became what people remember when there's Clinkz: ""He got Burning Army be careful"". IMO Death Pact should be a basic skill, or maybe a Shard/Scepter (I know Death Pact used to be Scepter). 

I don't really know much / remember about why they replace Burning Army, but if I can guess probably because it's OP. But this is definitely not the solution. And this is probably just me, but the game design in recent years has becoming more messy, like adding a LOT of questionable and unnecessary stuffs.

Discord for Storm Spirit/midlane enthusiasts/general tips and help:  [https://discord.gg/3SwAs2c](https://discord.gg/3SwAs2c) 

&amp;#x200B;

Laning stage:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm skipping Bottle completely. Instead, I will acquire four Nulls throughout the laning phase, Boots, and for 5th item it's usually Wand/Raindrops. The reasoning for this is Bottle no longer maintaining fountain refill once you leave the fountain, therefore losing its value dramatically.

Alternatively: you can still go Bottle and opt for three Nulls instead. Or have four Nulls and Bottle in the pocket, using it only in fountain or at runes.

With Nulls and their components being delivered constantly, Storm trades very well in lane, and against heroes that aren't slippery, can comfortably get a kill by level 6.

And, as always, if you can't make plays in mid, you can always rotate to the sides naturally from a camp or a rune.

The laning phase culminates around minute 10 once you upgrade your boots to Travels. Entering -

&amp;#x200B;

Early Game:

&amp;#x200B;

Key component in this playstyle is abusing Travels every time it's off cooldown. Default scenario is spending most of your mana on a pickoff/teamfight, then teleporting back. After \~10 seconds you're ready to leave base via short zip and walk towards next area of interest - this results in \~20 seconds downtime after teleporting back to base, and after that you're ready to zip again. This completely negates the mana regen component of Storm's playstyle from previous patches. We're going all-in on our damage output.

If the game is going passive, and your team is comfortable just farming instead of skirmishing (i.e. late game carry), you can also spend your mana rotating to/from more-dangerous-to-farm-lane-creeps into nearby camps, or vice versa, always ending in teleporting back once your mana is spent.

After Nulls and Travels, we save up for Shard. If we have extra gold before min 15, we grab Ogre Axe too. Four Nulls+80% mana zip+Vortex combo+Shard will comfortably kill most supports, and many non-str carries.

&amp;#x200B;

Midgame:

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually your pickoffs will dwindle, the enemy will start to group, and you are less likely to encounter pickoff opportunities where you get to stand and attack during Vortex combo. Fortunately, by that point we're midway to our next item - BKB. The thing about this particular Storm playstyle, is we acquire powerspikes very rapidly. Min\~10 travels, min \~15 shard, min \~20 Bkb. Once you are no longer comfortable with pickoffs, you switch to farm mode, once again shoving dangerous waves and farming away from your carry using your superior mobility via travels. Once Bkb is ready, you are once again back in action, no longer afraid of any disables, able to comfortably remove most targets during upcoming skirmishes. As a bonus, our four Nulls we've been holding on to have now doubled in power by min 25 - even further expanding our kill potential.

&amp;#x200B;

Lategame:

&amp;#x200B;

We'll be riding the same playstyle all the way to the end - show up to a teamfight/pickoff, eliminate a target, teleport back, be ready to go again in 20 seconds.

The only difference is as enemies get more tools to survive, you continuously increase your damage output. Our next item is Orchid, usually arriving by min 30. Only now do we sell our first Null. Next we will upgrade our Orchid to Bloodthorn - this let's you pickoff most \~2k hp targets, provided they are not saved by teammates or Aeon.

Next item is Aghanims. We also sell our second Null. By this time we should also be level 25. Bthorn+Vortex+Shard+25 Bounce Talent = deleting most targets in 2-3k range during our Bkb.

This build culminates in a Moonshard pickup. If you get a good zip and the enemy team does not have BKB piercing disables to stop you, or a support with hard save (Oracle, etc), you can comfortably nuke 3k+ hp targets in the middle of the entire enemy team, especially if anyone from your side contributes.

This will singlehandedly stop any base-sieges where your team just needs someone to initiate.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultra-lategame

&amp;#x200B;

Most games do not reach this stage. But in case they do - always judge by context. You can further double down on damage if your targets are reaching 4k+ health pool - something like Deso or Rapier will let you finish almost anyone and zip out in time. A Refresher is also great if the enemy team cannot interfere with your combo. Unless you're massively outdrafted, ultra-lategame Storm can outshine most carries by sheer power and mobility.

&amp;#x200B;

Talents:

Attack speed/Health/Vortex Duration / Bounce

&amp;#x200B;

Neutrals:

Fairy Trinket / Enchanted Quiver / Timeless Relic

I was very happy with Persona when it was added to the game. But it's very frustrating when some of the simplest things are bugged and annoying.

1. Chat Wheel Line for Master Tier of Dota Plus says ""What kind of fight is this?!"", but Mirana's voiceline is ""Sagan that tickles!"". Is this what it's supposed to be?
2. Teleporting with low/full HP voicelines are messed up. A) TP-ing on *full HP* to T1 tower can cause Mirana to say ""Coming back home"" B) Same story, *full hp,* but she says something like ""I'm getting off here"" in a tone like she was badly injured. 

And well, can we please have the taunt back for Persona? It would be amazing.

Thanks!",1651076114

DotA2,Getting tilted with my friend,"Me and this guy have been playing Dota since 2013 on-off. We recently took a 2 month break from the game, but I swear to god his habits never change. My friend is a pos 5 main and he used to send his solo games to this coach when we were lower ranks (Legend-Low Ancient). I (Divine 5) am generally a mid player but I don't really stick to roles so usually after long breaks, I play 1 because I can switch my brain off compared to when I play mid. He is Divine 1 btw.

SO we were playing this lane with PA and AA, both not very strong laners. We were against Primal and Grim. Basically my plan was to play safe because if we get caught, we're pretty dead. I told him before game started to BLOCK the hard camp and pull small once the lane gets pushed. He didn't listen for the next 2 minutes until the lane was static at the offlaners side. I was so tilted, so he decides to pull the small camp only to realise it was blocked then I died to Primal and the Grim combo. I then got so fed up I bought 3 sentries to block the big camp and unblock the small and deward. I swear to lord I told him to do this 3 times and all he did was kept quiet, he refuses to buy salves after buying 1 from starting items. So now my team is flaming the both of us right, for feeding cos he completely ruined the lane. He finally opens his mouth to tell me, I'm muting them. I almost screamed at this point. This other habit he has is to literally HOG the observers, I swear to god, I am not kidding when I tell you this but he kept 8 sentries and 11 observers in his inventory. Every game, I ask him nicely, why can't you go smoke and place some of the wards at least. He tells me 'I'll die'. I swear some people aren't actually meant for games like this, I don't really get why you're scared to die. If he wasn't a pos 5 main, I'd be a bit more understanding in lane but damn no wonder most games, when I'm playing some other role, this guy gets flamed by the 1. 

Worst part about all this is he tells me that he wants to win, but I swear he buys the OBS on cooldown but the sentries are always 10 in shop. When i get really tilted, I'll just tell him to pass me all his wards and buy the remaining 10 sentries. I place most of them and deward a few so that at least the cores can try to go out to farm somewhere. Just wanted to rant because I swear this has been happening for a very long time but he doesn't really want to change the WORST habits of a pos 5 main at Divine.",1651073693

DotA2,How does normal matchmaking work?,"I always thought there was a hidden mmr for normal game matchmaking.  


I'm a legion 1 player with around 5k hours on record.  


Now, my playing is probably far from that since I didn't play much for a very long time and only play occasionally nowadays, for fun. So normal games.  


Anyway, I just played a match with only solo players on both teams. Our core was a legend 3 jugger, pos 4 was legion 2 Io, and so on.  


then there was the position 5 CM with his third game on record who created his account just today. Believe me from gameplay this was no smurf and he said it's his first day of dota and not to flame him.  


The jugger half flamed him, half was just frustrated with this 100% sure loss we could do nothin this game and the CM rightfully rage quitted.  


This was bound to be a bad game for this CM right from the start (3 loss in a row as I can see from his profile). How did Dota think this was good matchmaking? I'm playing EU west at like 16:30 o'clock, a time where I looked for a match for less than 1 min.  


This CM is sure to not come back to dota and a new player is lost by such absurd matchmaking. I mean a player on his first match was matched against a Chen player that microed his creeps well... what the fuck?  


Ah yeah, did I mention that Dotabuff thinks this was a high Skill bracket?

DotA2,"PSA: Underlord shard is bugged and does (almost) literlaly nothing, don't buy it.","Shard sounds amazing in theory, 3 extra ticks of the max HP burn and faster ticks to do more damage on enemies while trapped in your pit, but in reality the shard only gives extra 3 waves of the 70 damage per wave, but does NOT give extra ticks HP burn.

I tested it out on the dummy in demo mode, and the results were (with level 4 firestorm and no talents):

Normal: 1663.8 ([screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/7YkaEiB))
With Shard: 1821.3 ([screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/IsGkYVw))

The behaviour of the normal firestorm is 6 waves, giving both wave damage (70) and HP burn damage on every tick (4% of max), as well as a 2 tick lingering HP burn. So in total you get 8 ticks of HP burn, and 6 ticks of wave damage.

With shard you would then expect to get 9+2 ticks HP burn, and 9 ticks of of normal wave damage. In reality you DO get your 9 ticks of wave damage, but you only get 8 ticks of HP burn, the exact same as with no shard.

If i had to guess the reason for this is that probably it is coded as a DoT damage, so you are actually doing 4% HP damage every second. Without shard you have 6 ticks with 1 second interval +2s linger, so 8 seconds total, meaning 8 ticks. With the shard you increase the waves to 9, but you also shorten the duration of each wave by 25%, so the actual time spent under firestorm is 8*0.75+2 = 8.75, which would result in 8 ticks of burn damage assuming damage is dealt every rounded second.

Can see a little excel sheet here with the numbers showing the calculations on no-shard

3 accounts with below level 30, nobody in my team feed by throwing the game, just a coincidence or are just people boosting accounts to sell to another guys and grab money when they killing the game?

I want something new in dotaplus besides the treasury. At least add one more set for these heroes that are on sale. For example: gyro, qop, rubick and others.

DotA2,Playing against 5 STR heroes make me wonder what is even the point of INT heroes,"STR heroes seem to have lower manacost than INT heroes, so the difference in manapool is insignificant, worst case they can carry a mango, which makes heroes like Nyx or Lion and their manaburn completely irrelevant against them.

STR heroes have the same damage values on their spells (damage, stun, slow, etc.) so technically they get better value per mana spent by casting their spells.

STR heroes have higher HP (duh), but ALSO deal as much or higher damage with their spells. They can afford to attack and it won't be a one-way ticket to tavern because of their high hp.

STR heroes often have high movement speed and/or mobility boosting ability which makes them even more dangerous.

So, I am not super high ranked (only 2300 mmr), but sometimes I don't fucking get this game. Why pick any traditional support when you can pick, say, Marcy, who literally has EVERYTHING except for innate BKB and beats the shit out of any conventional support. You just win lane because you have more HP, same or more damage, can just rightclick to death due to higher MS and HP difference, and then just proceed to win midgame because they still simply have more HP.

Another one said there’s a market for it so he buys an account and plays on it until he’s dropped too low and then buys another account. 

I just don’t understand the logic behind it. Why waste money on an account that is way higher than your actual skill level just to feed and get insulted by other 4 players on your team? I’m not making this post after a few games with boosted players, literally every other game in divine/immortal bracket has a boosted player. Sometimes it’s on my team, sometimes on the enemy team.

DotA2,Can't Find Games W/ New Account,"I had a Steam account that was 4 years old. I did not like the username &amp; since we can't change it so I put that on the deletion queue by contacting Steam support. Then I made a new account, started playing Dota. When asked I clicked that I have played Dota before. I purchased some other games on Steam like Dead cells &amp; Batman as well

But it seems like I am shadowbanned or something. I can't find ranked games for 20+ minutes all roles (calibrated legend 2) and even normal games take 5+ minutes every single time. 

Idk what should I do. Should I contact Steam support &amp; tell them about my problem. Will they ban my account because according to them I am a 'smurf'",1651023281

3rd ranked game - this time an enemy picks Puck. He has script hack and is dodging every stun with jaunt even when he's blinked onto by smoked heroes. He later uses his scripts to insta-ethereal blade + dream coil + force staff me and my team mates into stuns and silence all within a split second.

DotA2,How to get into Dota 2 Esports?,"Hey guys!

I've been playing Dota 2 for a few years now and I know nothing about the pro scene and I truly mean NOTHING. I went to the watch tab and I don't know any of the teams, none of the players, and I don't even know how TI or DPC works.

So my question is, how does one get into the esports scene? I know that you have to be interested in that kind of stuff and keep up with the updates, but where can I start? There is a lot of stuff on the internet but it is just too hard to follow.

I watched some games with random teams on the watch tab and ngl it spiked my interest. I would really appreciate if someone would recommend to me the best website to keep up with the esports. I would like to be aware of the ongoing tournaments and the ones in the future.

TLDR: any good esport tracking websites or a page that explains how dota 2 tournaments work?

Yours sincerely,

DotA2,Some info and tidbits from a podcast from earlier today featuring Fly,"Fly was on a podcast with other Israeli e-sports players earlier today ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l-RLADiUgs) \- they talk in Hebrew)

Here's some of the things he said:

\- He currently lives in NA

\- He received several offers and is in-between teams

\- He still plans on playing professionally. Mentions he recently coached TSM but didn't really like being a coach, could be because it's the wrong time for it.

\- 'Says it's difficult to know till' what point you can play and  Dota probably won't live forever and at some point there will be less people playing and money involved. he plans on pursing a career in e-sports as it's only just starting and still evolving and there's a lot of options

\- Asked about notail, says there's a story, history and friendship there ('less so now', probably meaning none), prefers not to talk about it again as he recently talked about it on a different podcast and its personal

\- Becoming a pro is a hard choice to make. You have to sacrifice everything in order to succeed, and you have to know you actually have the talent for it. Not everyone can be a pro just like not everyone can be an NBA player.

\- He doesn't consider himself a fan of any particular player, but he respects a lot of players and says you can learn something from any player you've played with and experienced something with. He learned something from every player he played it and wants to constantly learn and evolve as a person and as a player.

\- Having a relationship (partner) can be difficult at the start as you probably don't know how to manage your time, but he's had a girlfriend for over 8 years and having another person to support you is helpful

\- Mentioned starting out as a HoN player, says he got into e-sports when someone offered him to play for an amateur team and that person happened to work for Fnatic

\- Says that when he started he had no intention of becoming an e-sports player since prize pools were something like $1k or a laptop (around 2010)

\- When they started (at Fnatic?) their salary was around $300. The highest amount they were paid at Fnatic was around $3-4k

\- The biggest jump in salary was when he got into EG. He can't disclose details because it's recent but it was much higher than Fnatic

\- Salaries in Dota can fluctuate a lot, you can make a lot of money or very little. 

\- There's EU teams that offer as much money as NA teams (might have been talking specifically about EG?)

\- Says he doesn't feel like moving from HoN and becoming a good player was hard since they are both the same genre. Says it would be like him moving from Dota to LoL, it would take him a few months to a year to become a really good player.

\- Says he never felt pressure financially and was always winning enough to live comfortably

\- Most important things for an e-sports player are talent, work ethic, being able to look at yourself before judging others which most people fail to do. In public games where you lost and people blame each other, he first thinks about what he did wrong and only then thinks about other things. Also, you need to be someone who people can work with. He had experiences playing with people he didn't enjoy playing with. You see it in tournaments, where someone might say something that was out of place (paraphrasing) and all of a sudden you start having doubts about the game.

\- Everyone handles losing differently, but e-sports players at a high level can generally maintain their emotions since you lose all the time, even in pub games, and you often lose a lot more than you win since tournaments can have a lot of teams and only the 1st place wins, reaching second place is still losing. He generally takes some time before looking at replays and looks at it without involving emotions, thinks of what he could've done better and then what the team could've done better.

\- You constantly have to evolve and keep an open mind. New players are coming in all the time and they are generally younger than you are.

\- He doesn't have a certain pose or way to sit, but he played with players that find it really important.

\- You have to maintain your body and eat healthy, and it's better to start off early. Dota players are generally older and he knows players that have back and elbow (think he meant wrist?) problems, and some that can't play because of that anymore. Says you don't really know for how long you can play as an e-sports player as it's not strictly a physical sport. He's 29 and feels great, and has been exercising daily and eating healthy for 8-10 years.

\- Dota drastically changes between patches. No game is ever the same and you have to keep learning. When there's a new patch teams start making new strategies but as time goes on teams start playing similar to each other.

\- Someone asks about Ana and says he heard he's famous for playing his role very differently than others and that it changed things in Dota. Fly says Ana played more aggressive than other people in his role. Asked if people tried to copy Ana, he says people tried to copy him as is often the case where there's someone who wins and people decide they want to learn from him.

\- Says he loves the pressure in tournaments and that he feels playing in-front of a crowd and on a stage makes him play better. Playing from home is a different game to playing in-front of a crowd.

\- One of the peaks of his career is winning the Manila Major. Having Hodor open the doors was crazy.

\- One of the low points of his career was losing at TI6(or TI5?) where they were favorites and they had a really bad loss. Says he's usually a very calm person but he was mad at himself and wanted to punch something but a camera was following him.

He talked about other stuff but these are the things I found most interesting",1651010625

I feel like ALOT less people would have such an issue with where this hero is in the meta if this was fixed.

Then I tried getting a translator integrated right into the game, but none of them seem to work.(https://github.com/ur0/DotATranslator | http://www.sletmo.com/dota2translator | http://dotatranslator.azurewebsites.net/)",1650971612

DotA2,Why you might be playing above your level," Dota is a team game, but if you are a teamplayer in a bracket where such gameplay is actually griefed by your teammates, it may be a sign of you playing above your bracket.

If you go position 5 Lich and play like a proper 5 should, i.e by spending your networth on regen for your carry yet he fails at every stage of the game, you will suffer severe braindamage. One example is him last picking pos 1 Sniper into Timber 3, buying no regen and attempts the Topson build. Worse, when his gameplay does not work out, he pings and blames you for picking Lich instead of a ""useful"" support who has a stun like Lion and all chat's ""gg end"" as he afk farms jungle.

When you go position 1, your support picks Pudge, sits afk in trees and misses all his hooks. Leaves lane without buying you a single salve -- completely different to how you play support -- and doesn't buy any wards either, because why would he?

You lose your lane and so does your mid and offlane forcing you to 3-man jungle while the enemy dominates the whole map. Now, if you are a teamplayer you might be inclined to try and fight with your team, use voice chat to call for smoke ganks on solo enemies and create chaos on the map.

From experience, however, this doesn't work below 6k. Not even in divine dota. The only way to gain MMr up to 6k is if you pick a hero that can ignore your whole team and can recover / afk farm until it can give 1v9, like Luna/Medusa/Tiny depending on the meta. This allows selfish pos 1s to climb by playing solo in a game that's supposed to be a team game until they reach a certain MMr that's way more coordinated and where such incorrectly learned gameplays are actually punished, but which is the gameplay they have learned and can't seem to discard, so they continue it even in 6k where their 0-2-1 gamestyle is actually a huge detriment to their team.

These players, however, keep gaining MMr up to this point (6k) -- and that, by the way, also includes greedy supports who pick, for example, Sniper and play to become a second core to increase their chances at winning as opposed to standard supporting. Who don't gain MMr? Those who play the team-game proper because their team-oriented gameplay is actually punished in a game where their teammates don't understand drafts, items, positioning or gameplay in general. And yes, that includes divine. Even in 5k people are completely oblivious.

Point being, if you find yourself reading up on guides, watching replays, thinking about the game etc yet you just can't seem to win, it might be a sign you are playing above your bracket with teammates who make every game insufferable for you. It doesn't matter if you are an Archon player who has given up on ranked and only queues unranked or someone hard-stuck in divine. Dota is a team game, but only after 6k. Until then, it's a constant grind with insufferable and egoistic teammates with whom you in 90% of games can't make any teamplays with yet yearn for the 10% of the games where you do get decent teammates. So, don't take it out on yourself or feel bad whatever your MMr is, supposed that you do play in a very team-specific way. It is the correct gameplay, but sometimes when your teammates play incorrectly, you just have to do the same to win.",1650970514

DotA2,AU/SEA region discord community,"Hey AU/SEA Dota community,

I’m starting up a discord community for mostly new or lower rank players (herald – legend) that want to play inhouse 5v5 captain's mode and 5 man party queues. Higher ranks are also allowed but subject to the players who are organising the games since this could cause imbalanced games. We will also try to organise stacks for the weekly battlecups

I also think this will be a great place for new players to learn and find people who are friendly to teach them stuff about Dota. For the more seasoned players we will run as many inhouse games as possible to engage in some more organised games that will require teamwork.

Discord invite link: https://discord.gg/qt7A3ZPvSG

Some things to consider:

- Our server is based in AU/SEA server, so most games will be played on these two servers.

- Entry to Discord requires some basic info to be posted in a verification channel such as preferred region and role, rank, behaviour score, the reason you want to join.

- Verification process won't take long, so it won't be much of a hassle.

Any other questions you can reply here or in Discord.

Thanks for considering and hope to see you there soon!",1650964339

DotA2,Shoutout to all the non-toxic players,"It's very common to see posts here complaining about toxicity. I myself spent a couple of months without Dota because just queuing for a match (even unranked) would get my heart rate up. The stress was almost palpable. This is stupid, right? It's a fucking game! And I agree with you. I wish I didn't have this automatic reaction.  


But knowing that a small slip up can get people to lash out on you, and even if you pre-mute all, you will have to mute in-game to prevent the spam pings and sarcastic ""well played""chat wheels. And this is far from the worst case scenario.  


I decided to queue again a couple of times a week because I do like playing Dota. The games where both teams actually try to beat each other, but at the same time are chill and have fun, are just amazing. And this is what I want to talk about.  


In my last 8 games or so, I had ZERO toxic people. I solo queued on all of them (Crusader, EUW), and even got matched with two parties of 2. People communicated nicely during strategy time to switch lanes. Those who didn't speak english well made an effort, as did I to ping and alt-click stuff. Even when we lost, people just chilled and said stuff like ""shit happens, gl next, take it easy"".  


And this is what it's all about, man. You guys are the real heroes. This is a fucking game which 99.9% of us play just because we enjoy it. Also to take a break from the cruel world out there. I don't see people losing a game of checkers and flipping the table if they lose. Even when you play football (soccer), people rarely ever are assholes to each other, even when things get heated sometimes. Seeing most people I've played Dota with recognize this and just be regular humans who are playing a game together makes me super happy.  


I still get jittery when queuing, and it's something I want to change about myself. Because why the fuck do assholes get the right make me anxious? I play Dota to get matched with superior people like you: fun, can admit their own mistakes, don't chastise you for making mistakes, and are just pleasant to hang with in-game. Win or lose.  


Godspeed you beautiful creatures.",1650962556

DotA2,Why has Arteezy become so elusive to his enormous fanbase?,"Does anyone know exactly why he seems reluctant to engage with his fanbase online now? He used to be so much more active.

He has built such a huge and lasting fanbase that has stuck with him for 8+ years, and yet he doesn't seem to nurture the brand, the fans, and his online presence the way one would expect from such a popular figure. He could literally do everything to milk that fanbase for all its worth, but yet he doesn't. This is such a stark contrast from popular figures of most sports. 

He is easily the biggest dota streamer on twitch, having peak viewership of 25k+ when he streams, yet he only streams 10x a year if the fans are lucky. Despite his long breaks and absence from streamer, his fans always come back and stay subbed, but I feel like he could stream more and even make streaming a big side racket for him to make money. But somehow he doesn't. He is also the most followed pro on twitter yet engages with his followers with only 1 tweet per month if they're lucky.

I think his brand and fanbase is incredibly strong, but his lack of consistent online presence makes it impossible to keep up with him. And I think he is not maximizing the potential of his popularity the way he could.

Does anyone know why Arteezy has become so elusive to his fanbase?

To clarify, I am not demanding that he streams more, but I'm more rather curious on why he is not actively engaging a fanbase that is quite large and offers him great opportunities even beyond Dota.",1650954333

DotA2,Grimstroke crashes my game,"TL;DR My Grimstroke's character model crashes my game, possibly due to an immortal weapon cosmetic I have equipped (not sure exactly what cosmetic).

Whenever I select Grimstroke on the hero section of the home page it shows the hero page like it normally would and it attempts to load in Grimstroke's hero model. It fails to load him in and then the game crashes. Also when I am in the test stage if I try to spawn him in the game freezes for a couple seconds then crashes. 

I do not actually play Dota anymore, I just watch and every once in a while open the test map to try things that I'm wondering about while watching pro matches. So I have no idea what would happen if I tried to play a game and someone else picks Grimstroke. 

The only possible cause I can think of is the one cosmetic I have for him, I'm unable to check what exactly it is because it doesn't show the text or the icon for the few seconds I am able to have his page open. I am also not able to unequip it. It is in the weapon slot and I'm pretty sure it's an immortal item from a few years ago. 

This is pretty annoying because if I ever do want to play again I can't justify queuing because of the possibility that one hero pick will crash my game and force me to abandon.",1650947213

Also sometimes you just want to focus on jumping your camera to one specific hero (maybe it's your carry you want to ensure has a good game, or maybe it's your friend playing in your party etc).

So here is a proposal to do it with one hotkey. Allow us to group our allied hero in a control group. For example if I select an allied hero and make him group ""2"", then if I press the ""2"" button, my camera would jump to that allied hero and if I press ""2"" a second time it would jump back to wherever my screen was (working the same way as the usual camera save location hotkeys)",1650941241

DotA2,Turbo is too much of an Obama gold mode,"Was playing a turbo game. This LC gets an ultra kill against us, then 3 more kills. I'm thinking, game over, right? Our PA gets two kills when he overextends, gets a second item immediately, and then proceeds to unga bunga with 1800 crits. 

I loove the pace of turbo and think it's fine as a casual mode, but mega carries like PA, sniper and terrorblade can play like absolute doggy doo and come back instantly with just a handfull of kills. Maybe it's time to lower the comeback gold amount or introduce gold loss so you don't feel like a spectator or that you instantly lost if the game goes over 20 minutes against those heros.",1650925107

DotA2,Question about unobtainable ward skin,"Faithful followers ward skin was a part of TI10 battle pass, it is not tradeable, marketable and you can't get it at the legacy store.

Valve kinda fuels the fire to buy an account which has this cute ward, not to mention there are no alternatives that are obtainable. I know that selling/buying accounts is illegal and I probably won't do it because I only have 1 account and switching accounts to play is a burden.

Is there any other way I can get this ward? Thanks",1650915948

All positions selected. Getting 1\`5-30 minutes of queue time. Is this  normal? Is this just for accounts like mine that have been inactive for such a long time? I tried classic ranked queue and it got to 30 minutes and I've never tried that one again.

Outside of the queue time it's been a lot of fun but like it's honestly a little discouraging having to wait a half to a full games worth in time to actually get in one.",1650912083
DotA2,Oracle is such a uniquely fun hero,"The joy of watching the enemy right clicker visibly go into shock when they are disarmed as they try to wale on you

Blocking necros ult repeatedly with your W or ult

Nuking an enemy to death as they chase you in the laning phase thinking they have an easy kill

Ulting a teammate that turns the tide of a team fight even if they don’t survive

Coupled with the frustrations of teammates who BKB after you ult them so they can’t be healed by you

Or the morons who run away as you’re trying to heal them

Or the carry who blink dives in 1v5 then pings your ult because you didn’t save them during a stupid fight because of how far ahead they jumped

No matter how hard I try to explain to teammates how the hero works, it’s always a guarantee someone isn’t listening, forgets, or goes full lizard brain and panics during a team fight.  Still fun as hell to play",1650911460
