leagueoflegends,Is Zeri balanced around a feature that was never intended?,"As you may know, Zeri has suffered from a lot of hefty nerfs since her release a few months ago, sitting currently at a winrate of 44% in plat+ soloq.

Many nerfs focused on reducing her base AD which results in her having a very weak early game that barely rewards players for patiently farming and avoiding fights until mid/lategame.

The intend of those nerfs was to move her away from tanky builds, but also to stop rushing Sheen because Zeri interacts with this item very efficient.

However here is this clue: Zeri can proc Sheen with her Q as well as with her passive ""auto attacks"".

While it makes sense for Sheen to proc with her passive attacks (because it is treated as an ability), her Q description states it counts as a basic attack which means it shouldn't proc Sheen. I'm not sure if this is just an oversight by Riot or if they intended to keep this feature, however it seems to have caused a lot of problems for her balancing progress.

So my suggestion to push Zeri in a more favorable state is to remove her Q interaction with Sheen so she isn't forced to buy Trinity Force or Essens Reaver, and give her some base AD back as a result which translates to a better early game. (Maybe tweak her lategame stats in exchange)",1652851898

leagueoflegends,ARURF Account Setting Tutorial,"If you prefer the old URF bp mode, the ARURF would be a time killer just to play the champs you really desire. However, I tested that a new ARURF account that meets the following requirements could mitigate the AR effect.

1. Reach lv 11 to unlock F2P rotation. New players have a different F2P pool below that lv
2. Get 5 broken urf champions. A free one will be gifted from the tutorial: Brand, Yi, MF, Darius, or Lux
3. Play at least 10 games, maybe? Anyway it's kinda included in 1 if you don't use XP boost

For the 20+ games I tested so far, the chance of getting your owned champion is way above 50%. 2 RRs basically guarantee what you want.

If you wish to refresh your pool, you can refund and buy different champs within 7 days.

leagueoflegends,New Damage nerfs,"Do you think the damage nerfs were overdone, or that they should've been class specific at least to the degree to which they are done? I keep running into games where the enemy doesn't take much damage and just survives after being auto attacked enough times to stack conqueror as Aphelios with Infernum starting when they're at 30% hp, and sometimes the only armor they have is from boots. He was a Jarvan and a level ahead, but I had more items, almost three, and was close to a level up.

Mobile champions that usually bear a risk in mispositioning despite their ability to easily correct their position can just walk away from a fight whenever they want to because they're harder to punish with lower damage. In this case Miss Fortune, who doesn't need to be in your range to kill you most of the time anyways.

I know healing was nerfed, but I feel like I'd rather an immobile, squishy target who doesn't have much healing they can do to survive your whole kit heal themselves than a complete tank who is hard to damage at all, especially with the nerfs to damage.",1652844923

leagueoflegends,Buying a boost to Gold from Bronze is 100% worth it unless you can hypercarry.,"I boost accounts up to D4 as a side gig along school, I'll occassionally get an account that is stuck in bronze and man, I genuinely have no idea how players climb out of that hellhole unless they can 1v9, there is so much feeding, inting, toxicity, afking, you name it. The average player trying to climb out of bronze probably needs to play 1000s of games just to win enough to the point where they are pushed into Silver. Sometimes I get assigned someone that wants to duo and guess what, he skyrockets up in elo as soon as he's not playing on a team with 9 griefers, big surprise!

I genuinely feel so bad for the average bronze/silver player that tries their best and genuinely plays to win yet is hardstuck cause he has 9 apes on his team and isn't good enough to the point where he can solo carry the entire game. Riot really needs to implement something akin to low priority queue, you really shouldn't have to 1v9 every single game against griefers just to climb out of bronze lmfao. When I check the [op.gg](https://op.gg) of people that I've boosted to like Gold 4 at least I'll occassionally find that one dude that was hardstuck Silver 4 yet manages to climb to Gold 2 cause he finally doesn't have a team filled with bots that go 0/20. I used to think people that bought Gold boosts were just bad and/or wanted the victorious skin but I've come to understand them, who wants to play 1000s of games with Bronze shitters that do nothing but int. And before anybody says ""well there's also 5 bots on the enemy team"", I get that, but bear in mind a Bronze/Silver player likely isn't good enough to solocarry the entire game on his back.

leagueoflegends,Smurfing is not cheating btw,"Even though I suck, being the avid league gamer I am, I can't help but play ranked. It was an average ranked game until our jungle Jax went bot lane with a support item and afked there, taking cs and xp. Next he went top and mid and did the same thing. No jungle camps, no objectives, etc. The Ashe, the Blitz, and I asked the enemy team to report the Jax, and they agreed.  So I smurfed that game, hoping to scrape a win for my teammates. (i'm ""hardstuck"" bronze, and am supposed to be ranked silverish as I was last season, but I can't climb due to tilt and rage queuing) After I went like 20/2, the Zyra and Yasuo on the enemy team refused to report Jax, and wanted to report me instead for ""cheating"" by smurfing the game against people who are supposedly lower leveled and are still ""new to the game"". If they are lower leveled and are still new, then shouldn't they play draft first instead of going straight into ranked? (We still lost the game)

leagueoflegends,"I love this game, but the people who play it are the worst","I've been playing this game since the start of season 2.  I love it, even though I've never really been that good at it.  I played ranked that season and didn't have that much fun because the community in ranked vs norms was just really toxic, or so i thought.  Looking back, having people flame me for not being good, telling me what i should have been building, that was as good as it got.  I didn't play another ranked game until this season.  Not really sure why, but I thought, ""Hey I might as well give it another go, it's been almost ten years, I have a thicker skin, I know how to play the game now"" and all that is true.  But i was not ready for the level of petty nonsense that current ranked is plagued with.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to sound like an old person thinking back on the good ol days, but back then, a bad teammate was someone who is bad at the game.  Today, i had a 19/2/10 mid Zed decide to run it down and lose the game simply because our autofilled jungle wasn't good a role he didn't even pick.  My top banned my support's pick intent because ""Sona is trash, dont want her in my game"".  

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to play a nice, fun 5v5, but lately every game i get in feels like, at best, a 1v1v1v1v1v5.  It feels like the team that wins isn't winning because they are better, but because their team is slightly less petty and vindictive.

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm getting stomped, i buckle down and try harder.  I don't understand the ""making my team lose out of spite"" mentality, but it feels like I'm in the minority based on how often I've seen it.

[Art by Rhysers3000 on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/mzth6mhw34091.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a627a43c3ec95a4368a270f6cc80f21322d070c1)

Now that we are finally getting teasers and hints leading us to the inevitable reveal of the void empress, I thought it was no better time than now to show off my own champion from the Void.

Together with [Rhysers3000](https://twitter.com/Rhysers3000) on twitter, who made this amazing piece of art, we were able to finally bring my idea to (almost) life - Khal'Fasi, The Blighted Aspect.

The Void has always been my favorite region in Runeterra. But unlike other regions I've always felt like it was lacking in character and motive. Most of the Void champions have very basic quotes that don't reveal much about the nature and true intentions of the Void.

So that's why i made Khal'Fasi, a Targonian voidborn bruiser which resides in the top lane. Consisting of the corpse of the Targonian aspect of might and puppeteered by an intelligent voidborn parasite on a mission to wipe out the weakness that plagues Runeterra.

My goal was to show the clear morals and beliefs of the void through Khal'Fasi. A clear motive and plan the void has to take over Runeterra and shape it in the watchers' image. A compelling character which you can almost sympathize with... *almost...*

So while Khal'Fasi may seem surface-level at first I assure you reading its quotes and biography reveals some massive implications for Runeterra... and maybe even Arcane... as a whole.

At this point its widely known, that a lot of problems lol has, come from the fact that the code for LoL was written by some kids who werent real programmers 10 years ago. Its even come up in the ping-discussions around MSI because apparently some variable was named weirdly (dont really know if thats really what caused the problem im no programmer but it was said in a thread earlier today). 

So my question is: why doesnt Riot just build a new game that completely emulates LoL as we know it now, but with better code and therefore less problems. 

Is it too expensive? Are they too lazy? Are they too preoccupied to come up with the new prettyboy skin for cho gath which finally gives him abs and a stunning jaw line? 

I imagine that with all the trouble the curren code is giving them it could be worth it to just do a complete relaunch. They could even do some big marketing stunts and attract a lot of new players.

For players that are on &gt; 0 LP the LP loss is mitigated, however those with 0 LP drop to lower division and effectively loose 25 LP, which requires them to play 2 games to get into promotion and win 3 more to get back to the same rank effectively punishing the player to win 5 games for 1 that he lost unfairly.

I Don't know if its just me who feels this way, Its just shitty that now 4/5 games is against people who are farming challenges and challenges alone

leagueoflegends,Unpopular Pro Play Opinion: Way too much credit is given to Yas/Diana combo players,"With the exception of Caps/G2 recently, the vast majority of the time we see Yasuo/Diana the casters and spectators are out of their seats praising the Yasuo/Diana. The combo is *really* not that hard to play. While Caps actually played a pretty fantastic Yasuo, and Jankos had a good engage at the end of the game, it's so insane to me to see people act like them both pressing R is some type of insane outplay. There is a reason we basically never see those champions individually. 

The combo is ridiculously strong and ridiculously hard to play against. While you can make impressive plays with this combo, usually Diana E--&gt;R into 2 people is enough to sway the team fight. Diana initiates these combos with a simple point click into large AoE circular ability. Outside of Flash it is virtually undodgable and the only thing limiting the combo is Yasuo being in range. Generally speaking, they'll be able to get the combo off every single team fight. 

Outside of Caps's Yasuo play and Jankos' play at the end of the game, I haven't seen any impressive Yas/Diana combo gameplay all split. Even Jankos was being outjungled all game but still pulled out a good play in the end. It's so annoying to hear casters and fans pretend like the Yas/Diana combo is as impressive as the first time we witnessed Insec do a ward hop ult. It's harder to hit an Alistar knock combo than it is to get your ults off as Yasuo/Diana. I get its ""hype"" but it's disingenuous to pretend that we're witnessing anything impressive.",1652821763

The game is so hard for new players to get into, even my returning friends have gotten frustrated at how stupid the damage is for a fed enemy at one item. Bruiser/assassin snowball should be viable, but one of the best parts of the game is getting a good lane phase. I miss smart trades and not just who brings ignite wins. 

Currently, the game is way too much geared towards burst, and snowball. I haven‚Äôt had an enjoyable lane phase since s7/8 honestly. Played a bunch on the pbe and man it really does feel like a different game. Those early resists were much needed and I look forward to other people enjoying it as much as me coming soon. 

Lastly, we all know bruisers are gonna be outta control but I have faith riot will tune them down. 

That is all.

leagueoflegends,Msi 2023 format ideas(battle of the best vs battle of the worst(west)),"So lets just jump right into it. There will be 2 separate Mini Tournaments one for the the best teams in the world and one for the worst (determined through last year Worlds and Msi(if the winner is the same region its based only on worlds performance)). The 4\* Major regions attend. The best performing 2 in the ""best Tournament""  the  worst performing 2 in the  ""worst Tournament''. Also each major region can send 2 teams. To round up the 8 team groups there will be  4 minor region teams in both (can be determined trought draw for the 1st year and by performance the years after (2 bottom placed regions from each tournamet go to the ''worst tournamet""  2 best performing regions from each tournament go to ''best tournament'') . So since most people are now confused here is an example from this year . The best performing regions are Lck and Lpl the worst Eu and Na. So Lpl and Lck send Rng Tes T1 and Geng to the ''best tournament'' . Na and Eu send Eg 100T G2 and Rogue to the ''worst tournament'' . Now each braked gets 4 minor region teams .

 So possible tournamet groups are : 

'' BEST ''                                                                               '' WORST ''

T1                                                                                            G2

Geng                                                                                       Rogue

TES                                                                                           EG

Rng                                                                                         100T

minor region 1                                                                       minor region 2

minor region 3                                                                       minor region 4

minor region 5                                                                       minor region 6

minor region 7                                                                       minor region 8

Now that everyone is on the same page (hopefully) .(The 2 tournaments have the same rules) The group stage is a double (or single if riot determines those are too many games) round robin top 5 advance to knockouts .Knockouts are bo5s. 1st seed gets placed in the upper bracket final ,2nd and 3rd seed are placed in the upper bracket and seed 4 and 5 are placed in the losers braket. The winner of seed2 vs seed3 plays seed1 for a spot in the finals the loser of seed2 vs seed3 plays the winner of seed4 vs seed5 . The winner of the 2nd match in losers bracket plays the loser of the upper bracket final for the 2nd spot in the finals.

Here is a grafic of the knockout brackets(I did it in paint):

The 2 finalist from both tournaments advance to the final stage of the tournament as seed 1 and 2 . The final stage is a 4 team single elimination bracket (just like the one we have now). Seed 1 from the ""worst tournament"" faces seed 2 from the ""best tournament"" and vise versa. The winners face of in the finals and the winner is the winner of this years Msi.",1652816124

leagueoflegends,Thoughts after watching streamers play in Korea,"Hello, I am a diamond player in NA (peaked 90lp diamond 1)

After watching extensively steamers such as thebausffs, tyler1, Agurin, tf blade, and tarzaned play in korea, I am so glad that NA exists and that I‚Äôve been taking it for granted.

I‚Äôm not saying this because I think korea is more ‚Äúskilled,‚Äù I find that to be a common misconception.

After simply watching a few games played by any of these streamers, you start to observe a pattern: these Korean players literally only pick champs that allow them to fight early such as nidalee, lee sin, renekton. This is because for some reason these guys want to perma fight regardless of the comp, or the situation. For example, they would ping to fight a 3v3 even if your mid laner picked a kayle, or, they would ping to fight a 3v4 after seeing a teammate recall, or, they would ping to fight even though one or many of your teammates have low Hp or mana, or, they will ping to fight even thought they just successfully secured an objective or won a team fight and have a lot of gold on them.

And this doesn‚Äôt just happen in low elo, it‚Äôs the same playstyle all the way. These guys just want to fight always which in most games, end up throwing a lead or straight up losing a game.

As a scaling champ enjoyer, I‚Äôm really glad I don‚Äôt have to play in this extremely overrated region that has zero macro play or scaling. If you reach diamond plus in NA, you are able to secure most games by being smarter than the enemy, just like playing a chess game. But in this god forsaken region that is korea it‚Äôs all about who‚Äôs able to counflip a 3v3 at 5 min better.

leagueoflegends,@RiotGames re: Troll Duo's - plz fix (+ a few ideas),"Dear Riot,

I write this to you from a 5min waiting period I am GLADLY taking after dodging a draft in which I:

a) saw suspicious duo history on Porofessor

b) asked if they were planning to troll, and

c) received probably 1000-1500 wordds of continuos nonsense in return via \~100-150 idiotic messages, thus confirming my greatest fears: after literally JUST writing &amp; copy/pasting 2 identical well-thought, heartfelt reports for a Zoe-featured Troll Duo my PREVIOUS GAME that for the first time made me even ***consider wondering*** how difficult it could be to track down these 14yr old's, interupt them jerking eachother off while ruining another game for 8 of my kindred spirits, and scare the ever-loving-shit out of them (obviously in a legal &amp; totally non-violent way), thus scooping up &amp; replacing these lost youth's back on a more fruitful path in life... 

I digress...

Please do something about one of the most tilting aspects of a game that (excluding interactions w/ fucking dickheads) I truly enjoy -- repeated Troll Duo's. Dealing with 1 troll is bad enough, but can be manageable with an early enough ""/mute all"", and a heads-down, ruthlessly-selfish, *i'm-gonna-vacuum-up-all-the-gold-in-this-game-so-it-wont-matter* mentality.

A Troll Duo, is an entirely different animal for 2 main reasons (&amp; I'll revert to brevity now to cut to the chase):

1. I, and most of my other fellow league players, are not good enough to win a game with 2 players on my team a) inting repeatedly, and b) not farming &amp; therefore feeding their laner free CS &amp; tower plates/gold, and
2. Because they are trolls, the reason they do it, is that these 12-14yr old dickheads enjoy adding a third activity to their mix of j-ing eachother off while ruining my life -- laughing about how much lack-of-fun they can cause...so, question..how likely is it that these folks are going to surrender at 15? 20?? 30??!! 

I think you understand how this is an issue that needs resolving....to a potential solution ***(aside from perma-banning these 12-14yr old dickheads which is obvious, fuck suspensions, evaporate the accounts on a single instance of duo-trolling)***

&amp;#x200B;

**Fucking look at how much they type in chat.**

I really think it should be as simple as a regression on that + their KDA &amp; farming efficiency during the game that it happened. I'd bet whatever I've got &amp; then some that this easy formula will give you trolls with 95% accuracy at LEAST if it is true of both duo mates. It's one thing for one to have a bad game, someone's a chatty-kathy, and next thing you know BOOM -- but if you've got excessive chatting + 2 absolute bed-shitting performances + maybe even sprinkle in a ML algo to find an instance where someone in the duo reverts to calling someone on the team gay in response to a legitimate concern about the state of the game, god I swear this stuff is gold I hope this makes it to you Mr Riot.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, I think my queue should be off MY suspension for dodging (kinda funny when you think about all the trauma that I've had to endure, classic victim blaming imho, smdh...)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to head back into the wilderness &amp; meet my new Rift-squad......I'm really hopin for one of those good-vibes-translates-to-actual-good-performance type of teams, but if it's another Troll Duo, so help me Science, I guess I'll be back here to vent about it because I'm not sure how to get in touch with your customer service team...",1652810840

leagueoflegends,There's no reason not to afk,"I don't think league of legends gives enough incentive not to afk. I've played league of legends since maybe season 4 or 5, and over this time I don't feel like I have ever been incentivised to not afk if I am not enjoying a game. 

I wouldn't say that I regularly afk (more than once every 10-15 games), but whenever I go afk the largest penalty I receive is usually a timer to wait to get into my next game and a ranked lp penalty. If you are consistently winning games -2 lp for one game after you come back isn't going to significantly impact you and a timer to enter a game just gives you more time to watch a youtube video or netflix while waiting for the game since I'm already on my computer.  

My general understanding is that the community feels that riot doesn't punish players that are toxic or int enough to where they are a regular occurrence in people's games. Until these players are punished properly to where they are a rarity I feel that it makes more sense to leave the game than suffer until a report screen where your report will have no impact on the game. Should I stop leaving games? And were some games that I went afk in winnable? Probably. But until there is adequate incentive to not go afk and until players that actively ruin games are properly punished, I feel that it makes more sense to leave games that I feel are unwinnable or unenjoyable and do something else. 

Should I feel this way about the game?",1652809241

There's a tl;dr at the bottom if you don't wanna read a whole article. Just wanted to post some thoughts I had on the game before Patch 12.10 hits. Ultimately, the point of this post is to invite a discussion on the game.

**Introduction:**  
When mentioning the words *League of Legends* to any online gaming enthusiast, the response received is often a mixture of exasperation, revile, and appreciation, mixed with a healthy dose of nostalgia. It is the game that you visit this subreddit for, it is a game millions of people have sunk hundreds to thousands of hours into, and it is a game that has endured for almost a decade and a half from Alpha to the upcoming Durability Patch. It is also a game that houses contentious back and forths amongst many of its supporters and haters over both the minutiae and bigger pictures of game mechanics. Throughout the undeniably short yet also undeniably long tenure of the game, League has evolved from a simple derivative of DotA to a game that independently stands out in its own right. Inevitably, this gradual transition has not been without its ups and downs. Ask any staunch veterans about the horrors of Season 2 and 3 Kassadin and they may yet still lapse into a thousand-yard stare of 2.6-second silences and Riftwalks longer than Caitlyn's auto attack range. Perhaps they'll tell you about the time a rabid Smurf with a glowing hammer marked their support for death only to run a train on the other 4 members of the team over an eternity of 8 seconds. Or perhaps they'll tell you about the strategic nuances of a bygone era, the vision wars, the revolution that the arrival of the Koreans gave in Season 2, or perhaps even the whisperings of the Europeans inventing the modern mid-lane meta. Indeed, League has seen its days - better or worse - but what I want to discuss in this article is the fundamental underpinnings of a game that has endured for a majority of this generation's coming of age - the strife it causes, the desires of the developers, and the plague of the common player.

**The Identity Crisis of the Early Game:**

To call early League of Legends a mess is an understatement. Those with rose-tinted lenses over the bygone eras of Beta through to Season 2 are fast to forget the many fundamental issues of the time simply because it was in their ""better days"". Before the meta had been thoroughly established and before you could hop on one of many dozens of sites to provide advanced analytics - back when the best resource you could find was a dubious writeup posted on SoloMid or MOBAFire - League was a broken game: a glorious, but nightmarishly balanced mess that catered to the absolute extremes of player experience. It was a game inundated with non-interactive kits that lacked theme and cohesion, extremely punishing resource costs for commitment to abilities, and most of all, a general lack of understanding of optimization. The Wild West of the early days saw monstrosities like an Evelynn who could stun you from anywhere without the slightest warning, Rengar ultimates that allowed him to simply walk alongside you without your knowledge, choosing his earliest convenience to pounce, and games that seemed to stagnate and go on forever due to a lack of decisive objectives and a wealth of powerful waveclear.

It was a new game, and yet an old game - one that took the foundations of DotA and transported them to a different setting. This origin from DotA is something that continues to haunt the older generation of players to this day. And that is because old League of Legends was simply not the same game as the current one. In those grayscale times, DotA was a legitimate competitor in popularity and the main difference League catered towards was ease of access. Extremely esoteric and punishing mechanics with high learning curves such as elevation, turn speed, camp stacking, denial, tree pathing, etc were all abandoned within the early days of development for a more streamlined experience. But because the root of League was still in the style of Dota, that meant not all of the things came over fixed. You still had janky kits with prohibitively high-costing skills that limited lane trading, supports that mirrored the position 5 of DotA in terms of poverty at high levels of play, and end game abilities that could seemingly suck the life and soul out due to how long they could potentially disable your character.

It was in this early phase of the game where a lot of the more grizzled and disillusioned veterans come from, lamenting the loss of what they tie to their childhood. Nostalgia, after all, is a powerful drug that rights all wrongs. And, as somebody who played in those days, League was genuinely fun back then. But not because it was a well-balanced game, but because I played without even remotely caring about balance in the first place. Early League was an exploration, a journey, a discovery to unlock champions and learn new things. These are things that no matter what the patch notes say, cannot be regained. 

**The Rise of the Professional Scene and League's Loss of Innocence**

In its nascency, the problems highlighted above never presented too overbearing of an issue to a playerbase that was still stretching its legs. But once Riot Games and, the world saw the popular appeal the game had, its potential for even further growth, and the enormous market of professional sporting that it could tap into, that's when things started becoming more serious. And with more serious looks at the game came more serious changes. Perhaps this is when it all started going downhill for players who now spend their days bitterly complaining about their lost youth - when the game lost its innocence and luster for them.

The end of Season 2 into Season 3 are landmark years for League of Legends. Season 2 Worlds, and its enormous showing (at the time) proved just how viral the video game had gone from its first championship played in a Dreamhack hosted by Phreak's basement. Season 3 saw the integration of professional regional leagues over major markets in EULCS and NALCS. This game could make it to the big times. But the troubles of growth in esports are significantly different from the troubles of growth in traditional sports. The root is in accessibility. There is this firm idealogy, unlike in any other professional sport, where players of an online game can put themselves in the shoes of a professional in a way that cannot be emulated by the likes of football or basketball. I will never be tall enough to play in the NBA, or skillful enough to compete in UEFA, but League of Legends? That I can download right now. And if I play enough, and climb high enough on a public ladder, maybe people will notice me. Maybe a team will sign me. It is that dream that keeps the gamer going for most sports played professionally. The desire, and the visibility of an untapped potential to be good or great.

To cater to this market of hopefuls wishing to become Faker before even Faker played his first OGN, Riot slowly began trimming the fat around the edges of the game that made, what in their minds, the game unfun or noninteractive. Mana costs started going down to favour more dynamic laning patterns, flashier champions were released to attract new fans, and entire kits were remade in the name of cohesion and balance. To avoid the horrific experience of playing position 5 in DotA, Riot introduced multiple mechanics to make support more enjoyable at both higher and lower parts of the play, they began paying close attention to what professionals were abusing to win games, and for the first time, the separation of the average player and the pro player started widening (and I'm not bashing on DotA here, DotA2 has tried much the same in making the average player experience more enjoyable).

**The Divide between the Professional and the Casual**

The reality of the matter is that to become a professional in League of Legends is just as rare, if not even rarer than to become a professional in traditional sports statistically. The overwhelming majority of players are not even fit to play in the equivalent of a high school division 1 scene, let alone in a professional scene. 98% of NA's player base is below D4, 96% in EUW. Even amongst players that do ever reach Challenger, maybe only 1% of that 0.0001% of the player base lives to see the big stage. Yet this does not discourage people from playing and emulating professionals. Unlike in a game of pickup basketball where the limitations of not being able to dunk certainly will stop me from trying to dunk, lest I hurt myself in a grand humiliating fashion, the unabashed confidence of less skilled players to instantly attempt what they just saw on Twitch or LoL Esports is immeasurable. And this is where the player base starts becoming fragmented - because Riot fundamentally wants players to believe they can do these insane things, while also having to balance the game for its professional scene.

There is a reason the NBA, the NFL, the Champions League, etc. don't try to change rules based on the games played in AAU or at the park. It is because they simply don't need to care about complaints against a double rim, a goal that's too wide, or the size of an offensive line formation from those games. But Riot has to because professionals and casuals both represent a spectrum of customers that they want to attract. The professionals because they bring in new players, and the casuals because oftentimes those new players start off as casuals. This presents many of the problems people have begun to have with the modern style of balance because many times, they face a cognitive dissonance between the plays made at Worlds and the plays made in their SoloQ games. You see Ruler 1v4'ing with Aphelios only to have a completely different experience as ADC in SoloQ and that is because ADC is more heavily balanced around professional organized play than it is around SoloQ. 

These problems come from the simple fact that a group of 5 players represent the 99.999th percentile of skill, all in active communication with one another, and are also playing a different game from those sitting at home. Much like how the old game and the current game are two different universes, the zenith of pro play is simply a different universe as well, even on the same patch. And because balancing certain roles, champions, or identities around playability and favourability in SoloQ can often completely dismantle the competitive integrity at the highest organized level, Riot has to pick and choose favorites.

ADC is a prominent example. It is one of, if not the most important role in at least 40% of professional games due to its contribution to damage, siege, and formation. But you certainly wouldn't be able to tell that from playing SoloQ. Lo and behold, ADC players tend to be one of the most outspoken communities when it comes to the balance of their roles, and this isn't really their fault. The ADC role simply isn't balanced at the level of play most casual players play at, regardless of if that's in Ranked or in a Normal, and almost never will be. Certainly not with the lack of voice communication, a role that relies most heavily on interplay and teamwork suffers. And certainly, with a random assortment of teammates, it suffers even more. But give ADC too much agency and the game starts looking more like earlier years where the contributions of other players start to seem to matter less. Perhaps it looks like an Ardent Censer meta where even Faker at what I would argue was the absolute peak of his playing ability in his career, still fell 3-0 to Samsung. Perhaps it looks like Uzi dominantly carrying RYL to Worlds Finals two years in a row.

Accessibility, while great at bringing in customers, creates headaches for the balance team that could not be described. Any 30 year old man with a beer belly can play a game of Ranked with the same competitive fire as Caps in LEC finals. But he probably won't play as well as Caps, and he might end up dissatisfied with why his experience simply looks so different.

**How Riot Has Addressed Balance Over the Years - The Divide Amongst Casual Players**

Ultimately, because Riot cannot actively balance their five primary roles and many particular champions without playing favourites between pros and casual, it falls on other tangibles for them to make the game more ""fun and interactive"". This comes in the form of many changes that cater towards more accessible skillsets, especially among younger players as a target demographic, and has led to further divisions in the player base - those that come from the old game and had skills that flourished then, and those that picked up the new game and have skills that flourish in a new system. 

The old DotA structure of League was significantly more rigid with straightforward items and duels that were glorified and prolonged stat checks. Many Legendary items simply represented efficient swaths of a bunch of stats or gave them through an aura. Force of Nature was a massive ball of HP5 and Magic Resist, Will of the Ancients just gave everyone AP and Spell Vamp, Bloodthirster gave 100 AD and 25% Lifesteal, the list goes on. Another feature was that often the upper echelon of items like Infinity Edge, Deathcap and BT were prohibitively expensive while giving significantly more stats than they do now, while other items were incredibly undercosted. Thornmail gave 100 armor flat for an extremely low price tag, and yet was also very rarely bought, while Last Whisper gave 45 AD and 35% Armor Penetration for, at one point, the price of 2080 gold. Some items were also hilariously broken despite being rarely abused - an outlier coming to mind is old Lich Bane having a 1.0 AP ratio

So the question then becomes if the stats were so much higher, why does the damage feel lower from back then, and the answer is rather straightforward and threefold.

*Gold generation is significantly higher than it was back in those days.* 

1. Comparing a professional game from S2 or S3 to a professional game from now, teams are on average 4-5k gold wealthier than before by 15 minutes. This often represents the difference of an item completion and the gap only grows as the game goes longer due to jungle camps respawning faster and giving more gold, turret plating, and higher ambient gold. This is most noticeable in the Support role, where a good pace to be at by 15 in S3 would have been Sightstone + Boots. This touches back into making roles feel more interactive - supports that have more gold will feel more useful and want to play the game more. The same is true for junglers, who back in the earlier years of League, mostly functioned as secondary supports and now can be fully functional carries. The logic behind these changes makes sense, and in my mind, is good for the game. Players are simply more likely to play a game where they feel more agency, and not being able to buy items that aren't wards just isn't particularly fun. This endeavour has also largely been successful as in the earlier years of the game, almost nobody wanted to play as support. Now it is one of the most queued roles
2. Adding to the gold discrepancy are Riot's internal buffs towards secondary resource availability. In its early game state, mana regen was significantly lower across the board, skills tended to cost prohibitively larger amounts of mana, and ability rotations were partially balanced around being able to purchase consumable mana potions. Riot has since removed mana potions (allowing for more available gold to purchase) and incorporated higher MP5 stats for almost all champions to promote more interactive play in early game lanes. This ends up creating several consequences further down the line, as more trading means more lopsided matchups, means larger differences in level and income between winning and losing players. Because lower resource management encourages more trading, more kills happen, more plates are taken, etc. The same goes for early game cooldown management for most trading devices - as well as the release of significantly more resourceless champions.

*Players are much better at optimizing now than before.*

The game has evolved significantly over time, so much so that the Damwon that won 2020 Worlds or the EDG that won 2021 Worlds likely would have wiped the floor with 2015 SKT, a team that is often touted as the most dominant team of all time. The availability of online resources and the ballooning of the pro scene is in part responsible for this, but so too is the simple evolution of desire among gamers to want to be the most efficient. Optimization is the lifeblood of gaming - as seen from DPS calculators in MMOs to speedrunning in general. This is true for League too, where people have become sharper at combos, and more knowledgeable about what items to build. The mechanical skill floor has increased drastically from the days of oo'ing and aah'ing at Insec performing his namesake at All Stars 2013. And faster combos mean lower time to kill. Furthermore, the deluge of available resources to guide player experience is a double-edged sword. While it elevates the average player, it also objectively reduces how much they actually analyze what they're doing -thinking I should build X item because it is meta and not Y item is bad on Z champion being a good example. Analysts like LS have their entire brand on poor itemization choices due to sunken mindsets. A lot of the time, this is represented through a dearth of defensive itemization when playing roles that historically have always spec'd into defensive 6th item choices from the early days of the game (Banshee's Veil and old GA). Building Ninja Tabi on ADC used to be commonplace and now is all but extinct, not necessarily because it is bad (though it can very well be depending on the situation) but simply because it is viewed as *less optimal*. This is in part because doing damage just feels good - why be tankier when I can blow someone up faster? It's more fun to blow people up than it is to survive and deal less damage. 

*Builds are more streamlined and items focus more on interplay than simple stats.* 

Most items now give lower stats than they did previously but also incorporate unique passives and actives that are meant to interact with other items and abilities. Shieldbow gives less AD than BT used to, less Crit and AD than IE, and less Attack Speed than old PD, but in exchange gives all of those stats at once, while also incorporating a defensive measure in the build. You would have gotten more *damage* out of building 6 BTs on Riven in all likelihood due to having 600 AD, but it was impractical to do so (well, in all honesty, it probably wasn't that impractical). Riot wants the game to have a unique feel and identity for each experience, and part of that is giving different roles items that help them fulfill their role in the game. This streamlines the building process but also leads to less diversity in stats. ADCs tend to have significantly fewer defensive options, partly because they choose not to build them (see above) but also partly because their defensive options are items that serve offensive dual purposes. The same is true for bruisers with Death's Dance, and tanks with Sunfire Cape.

This presents in the form of a higher perception of damage simply because it was trollish to build in a way that promoted only damage in the early days of League, even if it meant you could theoretically do more damage. At the same time, it also makes the game feel more involved. There is nothing fundamentally interesting about somebody buying a 100 Armor Thornmail and making you deal less damage, but there is a clear and cogent decision-making process in building a Randuin's against a team that has a lot of Critical Strike damage. The latter is significantly more satisfying than the former on a mental level.

Ultimately, part of the problem is an unwillingness from the player base to want to adapt to the new style of gameplay, but also because many of these changes are meant to cater towards a better viewing experience in professional play and a better player experience for younger players that don't necessarily want to commit to a game that is built around stat checking. Casual fans that have played this game for many years and seen the gradual shift, however, face a crossroads on whether or not the game is even fundamentally the same. The answer is no, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just also not necessarily a good thing.  The pro players will adapt to changes because it is their occupation but the casuals are left in the dust wondering where the good days went. But the ""good days"" also had to go to keep the game refreshing. At least from the perspective of the company that puts out the game.

This discrepancy only magnifies as you climb up the Ranked ladder. Better and better players with higher and higher ambitions think significantly less necessarily about the mouthfeel of the game and will simply play to what is best to win. At the same time, the competitiveness that feels the need to climb is likely either the fire keeping them in love with the game, or sadly, sometimes the torch that fuels an abusive toxic relationship with a game they cannot let go of. In the case of the latter, no amount of balance changes will fix the underlying issue. But the question remains? Where do all the casual longtime players fit in the scheme of this?

The answer is that they don't for the most part. If players have auspicious desires, they have to get used to how the game has been and will be changing - whether that's in favour of damage or not. If they don't have auspicious desires for climbing in Ranked, then the question becomes why they should have a say in the competitive balance of a game in the first place. And this once again points back towards the divide between casual and pro, but also a divide between casual and hardcore. Not all League players necessarily have a do or die attitude toward winning, but undoubtedly there are some that both want to win to have fun, but also *don't want to adapt* to the changing structure of the game.

In fact, it isn't too rare to see people who play ARAM, a mode that is wholly uncompetitive in terms of balance due to the nature of stacking % increase and damage reductions, also want their fair share of representation in balance patches. The reality is that this is impossible as the constant juggling act Riot has to do between all the different players they have to represent simply has no room for these players either.

As an aside, one point I will vehemently oppose, however, is the notion of total *skill reduction* in the meat and potatoes of the game. This is just categorically false at the professional level, where teams have consistently improved and solved the game more and more to prevent even harsher balance challenges for the team. The niceties of the game have simply changed and required different types of skill, but a ""slower game with slower kills"" isn't at all necessarily a more skillful and strategic one. People who solicit such complaints about missing the ""strategy"" of the game from earlier seasons need to realize that the strategy of the game was significantly less developed in the era they were talking about. People who compare old League to Chess need to realize many games of Chess are a game of inches determined by a single move or lapse - much closer to getting one shot for being out of position than it is to some prolonged tactical standoff. Of course, there are also long games, but nobody would say a game of chess took less skill for having taken 40 moves as opposed to 70 moves. I've written extensively on the strategy and positioning behind team fights in pro play, the setups, the timers, etc. and there is never a *lack* of things to analyze at the very least, even though the fights don't last as long. People who can't see the strategy in the game simply aren't looking hard enough /endrant

**The Problems of a Constantly Evolving Game**

The reality is that this game will never keep everyone satisfied, and that's okay. Personally, I analyze the game because I am fascinated by the intricacies of it, regardless of what the state of durability is, and I would implore others to understand that ultimately, the game is for you to have fun. If you aren't, there is nothing shameful in taking a break until you *do* have fun. I think a lot of players on this subreddit just seem burnt out and bitter a lot of the time and would greatly benefit from taking a break and returning when they can find a passion for the game. Obviously, I'm not trying to shut down all criticism, but I think a lot of the complaint threads about damage creep that have cropped up in the past half-year have lacked critical forethought into the roots of where these problems originate and how we can necessarily solve them so I want to encourage people to examine these things in more depth by just sharing what insight I have.

I love League of Legends personally. Always have, always will. Sometimes I love it less. But I love it nonetheless.

**tl;dr:** The game has undergone a full evolution over the years and will continue to do so. The reasons for damage creep are many and varied, from resource management changes to gold, to optimization, and the durability patch, while seeking to rectify the problems the community perceives, should ultimately just be viewed as a drop in the bucket of a long cycle of changes that have brought the game extremely far from where it started. Honestly it's hard to summarize this post in short so just go read it smh.

**real tl;dr:** Riotpls this game imbalanced asf why won't you buff Maokai so I can cruise control into Challenger with a 99% winrate.",1652808637

leagueoflegends,Spectating ARAM feature,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe it's impossible to spectate an ARAM game live without having one of the players streaming it.  

Let's say for example you want to host a mini ARAM tournament. It's hard to monitor it with the current tools available.

There could be a feature like this:

* public ARAM tournament option available in customs
* up to 4 users can join the game to follow the game live &amp; monitor the chat
   * All 4 connections allow streaming the screen using 3rd party services
* if an official event, a request can be made to unlock all champions with a skin boost every game.
* guest accounts to allow users that don't have an account to join as a player without any requirement of following a tutorial first.

Having the option to have quick events like this could be a good market strategy to draw new players into the game.",1652808479

leagueoflegends,How to spice up playing League of Legends?,"I think we've all been there at some point. You've been playing League regularly, sometimes alone, sometimes with friends, sometimes more or less seriously, some times a bit more for fun, etc. It's been enjoyable, but eventually it gets stale. The same gameplay doesn't satisfy you as much anymore. Even though you still keep playing (I mean, we're League players after all), it doesn't hit the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: what do you guys do at this point to spice the game up again? Anything goes, from different game modes to different champions, specific team comps, etc. What usually works well for me: playing some customs with more than five friends at the same time, facing off against each other with random champs on Howling Abyss. Another one that does the trick is playing AP Twitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

What works for you? I think it would be nice to share our ideas, so that we can all learn from each other and have even more fun playing this awesome game. :)",1652807177

In the past days I played against players who would go an optimal boring build, scrim for drakes one minute in advance, roam lvl2 with the urf-canon, take towers when enemys were dead and bming in all chat and in emotes IN URF. It was all about the win in urf.... Me and my friend were shocked because in every other gamemode, including ranked, people didn't tryhard so.... hard.

leagueoflegends,Personal Tryndamere Rework Idea 2.0,"This is my 2nd iteration to my Personal Tryndamere Rework Idea 

\-so 1st off know that I Main Tryndamere and I personally have wanted him to get a rework for some time even before we was part of the polls.

\-I want him to get a rework not because I see him as busted or weak in fact this few patches he is in the best position he's ever been(Including the Nerf), -I do also understand why people see him as a toxic Champ and a unhealthy Champ for the game, his concept of being able to Crit in lvl 1 is somewhat a very annoying concept since it relies on chance thus making it difficult to gauge if whether picking a fight against an enemy champ or taking a poke against Tryndamere is viable.

\-I want him to get a rework base on lore reason, and have wanted him to get a treatment similar to Pantheon after all his lore does teases that it might go that direction.

&gt;Even so, serving as Ashe‚Äôs champion, Tryndamere now looks to an uncertain future. The barbarian king can see war brewing all too clearly on the Freljord‚Äôs horizon, yet he still thirsts for his own, personal vengeance, and begins to wonder if his predestined fate might not be at his queen‚Äôs side after all‚Ä¶

teasing that he might leave Freljord to take his revenge against the Foreign Beast(possibly Aatrox).

now what would I change to tryndamere kit when he finally gets his Rework, well Riot already addressed the things they won't change from Tryndamere's kit, on which I also Agree, see Tryndamere M.O revolves around having his health low which is why his Ult doesn't give him invulnerability from all attacks, only that he does not go below 1hp which synergizes with his 1st skill passive and his Crit Damage where when Tryndamere is at low health he gains additional Dmg base on his missing health and for Tryndamere Mains we view his 3rd spin CD reduce when Critting integral to his play style.

so what can we change -Most Tryndamere Main see his 1st and 2nd skill open to being changed as they view his 1st as important only due to how Tryndamere relies on it to make his trades worth as for his 2nd only few see it as integral and are open to it being changed completely, and there are also few who are open to modify Tryndamere's crit into something more align with the present standard -that being either make Tryndamere's Crit like Ashe where he gets additional Dmg or make it similar to the wind brothers where his crit chance gets doubled.

**LORE** 

here we can expands upon certain aspects of Tryndamere's Identity as his Lore has 1 key aspect that has been teased that was not expanded upon till this recent years and the would be ""Ildhaurg-The Iron Boar"", in Tryndamere's Lore this Deity a Demi-God similar to Ornn, Volibear, and Anivia was the deity his tribe most often prayed to-

&gt;Tryndamere came into the world knowing only the harshness of survival, for the frozen steppes where his clan made their home never truly thawed. Though they praised all the Freljord‚Äôs old gods, as well as the Cult of the Three, they prayed most often to a spirit-deity known to ravage the tundra‚Äîa hearty and unkillable tusklord. Since the raw materials required for armor were scarce, the clan instead put its resources toward the forging of great blades, inspired by their god‚Äôs ivory canines.

this was also the the reason as to why him and his tribe did not see Beast(Possibly Aatrox) as the Monster he is, as they thought his silhouette was of the Iron Boar-

&gt;An unusual storm swept in from the east, bringing with it an icy darkness, and a towering, horned figure silhouetted against the full moon.Some in the clan knelt, believing that their boar-god stood among them. This creature dripped with ancient magic, true enough, but he was not of the Freljord‚Ä¶ and those that knelt were the first to die.

now how would I expand upon this into his design and characteristic, well I would make it something similar to Elden Ring's, First Elden Lord Godfrey.

&amp;#x200B;

[Imagine as Godfrey as Tryndamere but with no Armor and the Animal Spirit's Visage is like a living semi transparent armor](https://preview.redd.it/ddgnffe9e2091.png?width=3258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c03bca380b04f3510b04f508ccd9b1d911b63da5)

where when Tryndamere is full of Fury he would be blessed with the gift's of Ildharug ""The Iron Boar"" to his chosen Champion, and when he's blessed he gets cloaked with the visage of the Iron Boar-

&amp;#x200B;

[This isn't confirmed to be the legitimate Iron Boar however Freljoridian DemiGods design can vary but yet encapsulate the essence of the original Demigod](https://preview.redd.it/bi98im7ge2091.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cfe2882dff9e3ea093d7aa6be974314c6453bd5)

In my previous iteration I didn't include any Aatrox(Darkin) aspect as so now my new changes is to mix the two aspects, that being the Blessing of Ildhaurg &amp; the Curse of Aatrox into one

&amp;#x200B;

[The re-creator of Demonblade Tryndamer has stated that this he made this changes to fit the Darkin Motif](https://preview.redd.it/n2lq7qe4g2091.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0c3ee29aee4004a9dee7fb2049966503adcb21)

So now imagine that when Tryndamere is filled with Rage he has the Iron Boar head's Visage is on Tryndamere head and the Iron Boar's Iron Shoulders would be on Tryndamere Shoulder, so similar to Udyr except Tryndamere has only one spirit being the Iron Boar and the Visage's silhouette is more semi transparent so your could see Tryndamere but also recognize the aura that engulf Tryndamere all the while having the Tryndamere head, shoulder, and Right arm morph with Darkin aspects, similar to Kayn Right arm.

so the concept would be that with the Blessings of the Iron Boar will Tryndamere finally have his revenge against the beast(Possibly Aatrox) that slayed most of his Tribe or be engulfed by the Wrath the Iron Boar gives to it's Champions or succumbed to the Curse the the Darkin has given him.

**SKILLS AND PLAYSTYLE**

As I've mentioned before we have already noted what are the things that stays and what are the things that we can change, and upon making this changes I thought of them with this in mind

* how to change his crit to fit the modern playstyle of LoL
* How to make his healing more than just spam heal and clutch heal
* how to improve/balance upon the abilities that are to stay

**Passive**:

&gt;CURRENTLY:  
&gt;  
&gt;Battle Fury:  
&gt;  
&gt;Tryndamere gains 5 Fury for striking a unit or 10 Fury for a critical strike, and 10 extra Fury for killing a unit. When out of combat for 8 seconds, Tryndamere loses 5 fury every second.Tryndamere gains 0‚àí40% critical strike chance (depending on Fury)

CHANGES:

Battle Fury:

Tryndamere gains 5 Fury for striking an enemy champion or 10 Fury for taking dmg from an enemy champion, and 10 extra Fury for Critical strike. When out of combat for 8 seconds, Tryndamere loses 5 fury every second.

Tryndamere gains 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 Attack Damage(depending on his Fury)

this changes would make it, that his Fury only gets filled when he strikes/takes damage from an enemy champion. this would make it that his Fury won't get filled so easily and be used as a spam heal mechanic.

and rather than just give Tryndamere 0-40% Crit Chance base on his Fury, Tryndamere would instead gain additional Dmg depending on his Fury.

**Q/1st Skill:**

&gt;CURRENTLY:  
&gt;  
&gt;Bloodlust:  
&gt;  
&gt;Cooldown: 12  
&gt;  
&gt;Passive: Tryndamere thirsts for blood, gaining 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 Attack Damage plus 0.15 / 0.25 / 0.35 / 0.45 / 0.55 per 1% Health missing.Active: Tryndamere consumes his Fury, restoring 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 (+30% of ability power) Health , plus 0.5 / 0.95 / 1.4 / 1.85 / 2.3 (+1.2% of ability power) Health per Fury consumed.

CHANGES:

Wrathful Strike

Cooldown: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8

Active: the Next Tryndamere Basic attack he would slashes horizontally in front of him dealing 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 / 120 (+50% of AD) and in max Fury when Tryndamere hits single enemy champion with this skill, he heals for 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 (+30% of ability power)(+5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25% of missing health) this ability's cooldown is reduced to half when Tryndamere Health is low.

Passive: Tryndamere's Crit chance increases by 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.6 / 1.8 / 2.0x (depending on his Fury)

Yes this kind of similar to spam healing however changing the spam healing into something that requires him to be active via keeping himself in combat, the Idea here is that Tryndamere can only benefit from high healing with this skill is when he is in constant combat. also I know this feel like turning Tryndamere into a Bruiser, which I know that many don't really want his playstyle to change into which I also wouldn't want to happen but I know for sure that if I tweak the stats rather than change the skill itself, it would better fit Tryndamere low health max dmg output playstyle.

and regarding the Crit chance, this was to remove the lvl 1 cheese Tryndamere has. Note that this change was just to address the concern of some players regarding his lvl 1 Crit lottery aspect.

**W/2nd Skill:**

&gt;CURRENTLY:  
&gt;  
&gt;Mocking Shout  
&gt;  
&gt;Range: 400  
&gt;  
&gt;Cooldown: 14  
&gt;  
&gt;Decreases surrounding champions' physical damage by 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80, and enemies with their backs turned also have their movement speed slowed by 30 / 37.5 / 45 / 52.5 / 60%. Lasts 4 seconds.

CHANGES:

Rageful Roar

Range: 400

Cooldown: 10

Tryndamere screams staggers any enemy champion nearby, reducing their Movement speed and Attack Speed by 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50%. which last for 2 seconds and in Max Fury Tryndamere's screams grows stronger making their blood curdle thus fearing them instead.

The changes I made was to give Tryndamere 2nd skill more impact although removing the Facet of ""enemies with their backs turned"" lessens the skill needed for this ability I had to balance it by reducing the duration of his slow and the Fear I also would bake give this ability to also allow one of Tryndamere unseen hidden mechanic to be known  that being the ability to sense enemy nearby even if they are invisible/camouflaged, as this skill may not damage the enemy champion it would at least show the enemies champion specter which would allow Ally champion to see them as well.

**E/3rd Skill:**

&gt;CURRENTLY:  
&gt;  
&gt;Spinning Slash  
&gt;  
&gt;Range: 660  
&gt;  
&gt;Cooldown: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8  
&gt;  
&gt;Active: Tryndamere spins through his enemies, dealing 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+80% of ability power) (+1.3 per bonus attack damage) physical damage to enemies in his path. Spinning Slash's cooldown is reduced by 0.75 second whenever Tryndamere critically strikes (1.5 seconds upon critically striking an enemy champion).

CHANGES:

Spinning Slash

Range: 610

Cooldown: 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 9

Active: Tryndamere spins through his enemies, dealing 100 / 130 / 160 / 190 / 220 (+70% of ability power) (+1.5 per bonus attack damage) physical damage to enemies in his path, the damage  degrades by 50% after hitting an enemy unit/champion. and in max fury Tryndamere Spinning Slash's damage does not degrade anymore as well as its cooldown is reduced by 0.75 second whenever Tryndamere critically strikes (1.5 seconds upon critically striking an enemy champion) and it's range is increased by 50 when spinning towards an enemy champion.

Here the concept of the ability remains almost the same, the changes were made to address the issue of how mobile Tryndamere is when its used to as an disengage note that the base range is lower and only returns to the original 660 range when Tryndamere spin towards an Enemy Champion this was to lessen his mobility when retreating as the Range was too much especially with the ability to reduce it's CD and to give more incentive I added a bit more damage to it and however its damage can only be more impactful if played right like.

**R /Ultimate Skill:**

&gt;CURRENTLY:  
&gt;  
&gt;Undying Rage  
&gt;  
&gt;Cooldown: 130 / 110 / 90  
&gt;  
&gt;Tryndamere becomes completely immune to death for 5 seconds, refusing to be reduced below 30 / 50 / 70 Health and instantly gaining 50 / 75 / 100 Fury.

CHANGES:

Unyding Rage

Cooldown: 130 / 110 / 90

Active: Tryndamere breaks free of all Crowd Control and becomes completely immune to death for 4 / 5 / 6 seconds, refusing to go below 50 / 75 / 100 and instantly max's his fury, while in this state Tryndamere has increased tenacity by 10 / 20 / 30 % he also loses all of his armor and magic resist and Turret Shots slow Tryndamere by 50% for 2.5 / 1 / 0.5 seconds. 

Passive: Tryndamere Attack Damage is increased by 0.25 / 0.45 / 0.65 per 1% Health missing.

the changes made were to make upgrading Tryndamere's Ult more meaningful as the dmg it gives as well it's function as an all in ability and making his Dive enemy under turret become more viable. also note that the slow effect was to address the issue of how Tryndamere gets to Dive enemy champs under turret in the laning phase to mid game.

I Understand that some aspect make it look like a Bruiser but I am confident that with some tweaks on the stats this would make it more inline with Tryndamere's playstyle of being a no armor/glass canon playstyle.",1652806711
leagueoflegends,Tryndamere needs love,"My dear champion after the nerf is very weak, let's be honest here, tryndamere needs attention, with each update and each new champion it gets harder and harder to play, all champions nowadays have a lot of mobility and shields and the critical hit is really bad even in adcs (vayne doesn't count)

Galeforce has been nerfed and tryndamere has been nerfed heavily, and now with this 12.10 patch I'm worried about the state of my favorite champion.

He is easily countered by any team that has good crowd control or a lot of mobility.

leagueoflegends,"I made a spreadsheet with over 60,000 VIABLE team compositions for completing multiple Challenges at once.","Ever since Challenges were introduced this patch, I've been trying to find ways to quickly complete them and get some of the titles and rewards. One pretty efficient way to do this is by completing Harmony challenges, which require a 5-stack with several champions that fulfill certain criteria (global abilities, terrain creation, stealth, etc.). I was largely made aware of this by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/up5flb/team_combinations_for_challenges/) that shows how to complete 7 Harmony challenges at once.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to expand on this idea by making sure you can complete these challenges with team comps that are actually viable. Many of the team comps in the post above are awkward and don't neatly fit champions into 5 roles, making them a bit harder to play (especially considering you have to win to get these challenges). They also don't include Variety's Overrated (win with 5 champs of the same ingame class) or the Globetrotter challenges (win with 5 champs from the same region). I figured limiting the team compositions to having 1 viable champion per role while adding these extra challenges would balance out and leave a decent variety of champs to use.

&amp;#x200B;

So, using some simple Java code, and OP.GG to determine champion viability, I made a program that spits out spreadsheets of viable team compositions and the challenges they fulfill. I've included all viable team comps that complete 5 or more team challenges at once, as well as a sheet specifically for completing the harder Globetrotter challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Here's the spreadsheet.**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jJN_3mmbIPbhcAxE8yQlq94SPVrk6g5JdgUzIYE5Ybs/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

Some fun facts about these team comps:

* Exactly one viable team composition **fulfills 8 challenges at once**: Mao'Kai, Nidalee, Galio, Ziggs, and Janna. This includes Variety's Overrated since all 5 are considered mages.
* The Globetrotter challenges are a bit harder to complete. The best you can get is a comp of 5 Yordles that fulfills the Globetrotter challenge and only 4 others. Most of the other regions only allow you to get 1 or 2 other challenges on the side.
* Mao'Kai is by far the most common champion overall and appears in nearly 90% of all viable compositions that fulfill 6+ challenges. He is incredibly versatile for these team comps as he can fulfill 8 out of 11 Harmony challenges, is considered both a mage and a tank ingame, and can be viable both top and support.
* Apparently Riot hates top laners since you can never complete more than 5 challenges at once if your team includes Darius, Dr. Mundo, Fiora, Illaoi, Jax, Mordekaiser, Nasus, Quinn, Tryndamere, or Yorick. Taric is the only non-top laner that also cannot complete more than 5 at once.
* Despite fulfilling literally none of the 11 Harmony challenges, some champions such as Ahri, Brand, Kassadin, Lucian, Renata, and Wukong manage to show up at least a few times in the 6+ challenges page. Honestly, they're mostly just carried by Mao'Kai.

&amp;#x200B;

What's considered ""viable"" is pretty subjective, and some people might want to try and make weirder team comps work. If you'd like to download and run the source code with your own custom champion pools, [you can find it on my GitHub here](https://github.com/sholmquist/leagueChallengeComps).",1652805320

I'm still playing enough to know every champion/spells/passives/... And I started in Season... 3? (Jinx release). I had some break where the game was not anymore installed.

Some weeks ago I was thinking of leaving for a while and Challenges popped out of nowhere and... GOD DAMN I love them. I'm playing everyday chasing for challenges/achievements, day n' night, i can't stop.

Spamming ARAM, Co-op vs Ai (Never thought I'll go back in this again), SR normal and ranked.

I haven't seen a lot of about this in this sub like they were never released and I was wondering why? Free hundreds of challenges here, rewarding your playstyle, titles, seasonal random bullsh*t.

This remind me the hunt of RPG achievements I guess...

Of course they are buggy in loading screen and maybe they could add some rewards to achieve ranks in seasonal/legacy category, but all the people I'm playing with just don't care and I don't know why, just ""because"".

- Why you care/don't care about them ?

leagueoflegends,Twitch QoL idea to help R's usability against high mobility champs,"Some champs can just walk out of his long range auto-attacks, which feels unintended and bad. E.G., Master Yi , Ekko.

My idea is that for Twitch's ult duration, he can use R again to shoot an auto attack in any direction. Of course, gated by his attack speed and sharing a CD with his auto attacks.
He can still miss these autos if aimed improperly, so this usage involves skill expression. 

I think this change gives Twitch a bit of additional power. For example, in some situation he might be able to hit 3 targets instead of 1, since he can aim to one side of the first character's model (instead of the center). Regardless, I think the change is right for the champion.

leagueoflegends,"The tankyness update in patch 12.10 is huge, dont let anyone tell you otherwise","Ive read some opinions claiming that the patch wont change anything and this is nonsense, let me tell you why.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 1: The midlane matchup is talon against lux, they are both lvl 6 and both have some tiny first items. Talon has 2 longswords and a dblade, lux has dring, cloth armor and the 435 gold book. 

This gives Lux 58 Armor + 1070 hp currently and 65,2 armor + 1224 hp on patch 12.10. Talon has 117 Ad and no armor pen yet.

Currently: Talon jumps her hits everything + autohit and deals 1345 dmg in total, resulting in 851 dmg post armor. Leaving her at 219 hp, he dealt 89% of her hp in damage.

patch 12.10: Talon jumps her hits everything + autohit and deals 1345 dmg in total, resulting in 814 dmg post armor. Leaving her at 410 hp, he dealt 72% of her hp in damage.

Lux will survive with nearly twice the hp left.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 2: The midlane matchup is talon against lux, they are both lvl 11 and have finished their mythic and a serrated dirk for talon and armguard (fully stacked) for lux.

This gives Lux 93 Armor (effectively 69) + 1495 hp currently and 106,2 (effectively 83) armor + 1719 hp on patch 12.10. Talon has 195 ad and 28 lethality, which i factored in.

Currently: Talon jumps her hits everything + autohit and deals 2254 dmg in total, resulting in 1331 dmg post armor. Leaving her at 164 hp, he dealt 80% of her hp in damage.

patch 12.10: Talon jumps her hits everything + autohit and deals 2254 dmg in total, resulting in 1235 dmg post armor. Leaving her at 485 hp, he dealt 67% of her hp in damage.

Lux will survive with nearly 3 times the hp left.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 3: The midlane matchup is talon against lux, they are both lvl 16 and have finished their mythic and two other items. Lux has zhonyas and shadowflame, Talon has ghostblade and seryldas. 

This gives Lux 128 armor (effectively 58) + 2120 hp currently and 147 (effectively 70) armor + 2414 hp on patch 12.10. Talon has 282 ad, 36 lethality and 38% armor pen, which i factored in.

Currently: Talon jumps her hits everything + autohit and deals 2987 dmg in total, resulting in 1890 dmg post armor. Leaving her at 230 hp, he dealt 89% of her hp in damage.

patch 12.10: Talon jumps her hits everything + autohit and deals 2987 dmg in total, resulting in  1758 dmg post armor. Leaving her at 656 hp, he dealt 73% of her hp in damage.

Lux will survive with nearly 3 times the hp left.

leagueoflegends,"The Feast Awaits - TF, Graves, Tahm Kench Fanfiction","Sometime last year, I was reading lore and it struck me that Tahm Kench and TF never had a story written, which I found odd considering they seem like a good antagonistic pair; The trickster trying to connive his way out of deals, and the demon of deals himself. I‚Äôve had this written since last year, but always felt nervous about writing/posting fanfiction or whatever. Though, with all the celebration of Graves and TF officially ‚Äòcoming out,‚Äô I figured now was as good a time as ever! üòÖ


Enjoy!


‚Äî


Bilgewater - A place of desire. A place of commerce, crime, and plenty of other words that start with C, if you catch my drift. One of the more odd ones you‚Äôd hear strangely common is‚Ä¶ Catfish. Legends go back as far as the eldest crooks and conniving criminals remember, some say even farther. ‚ÄúThe River King,‚Äù they call him. A catfish more fat than he is long, but with arms, legs, and a silver tongue so smooth he could talk you into a deal before you even realize whatever your eyes can see will never be larger than his stomach. A deal with The River King is worse than a deal with the devil himself, they say, because while the devil only collects his dues‚Ä¶ Tahm Kench can never resist a good meal.


‚Äî


Tobias leaned back in his chair. Ale in one hand, talking with the other. He‚Äôd always heard ‚Äòactions speak louder than words,‚Äô and though the Ace slipped out of his sleeve without a sound, the silence might have been the loudest thing in the room as he flipped his cards.


‚ÄúWell would you look at that! Royal Flush. Now I think these coins are mine‚Ä¶‚Äù


His chair hit the floor with a thud as he reached across the table, narrowly avoiding a knife piercing the Ace he just placed on the felted table.


‚ÄúWhoa now, my friend! A deal‚Äôs a deal, we each put up a fair share. You knew what you had to lose.‚Äù


Tobias‚Äô words couldn‚Äôt pierce the armored stare of the pirate they were directed at.


‚ÄúOne more game, ye cheatin‚Äô bastard. This time, NO tricks! We use MY deck.‚Äù


‚ÄúI really do have to get going, so while I‚Äôd love to‚Ä¶‚Äù


Two larger, more intimidating pirates placed their hands on Tobias‚Äô shoulders, shoving him back into his seat.


‚ÄúL-Listen friend, part of the game is knowing when to hold ‚Äòem, and when to fold ‚Äòem‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúIf yer‚Äô lucky, my men ‚Äúholdin‚Äô‚Äù you there won‚Äôt ‚Äúfold‚Äù you, now shut yer yap and ante up.‚Äù


Tobias‚Äô tired eyes glimmered blue as the river while he watched the dealer shuffle. He saw some light smoke seeping through the window nearby.


‚ÄúWell, if you insist‚Ä¶ Though, last I saw, Lady Luck was smiling at me.‚Äù


Hands were dealt. Tobias struggled against the weight on his shoulder to lift his arm and see what he‚Äôd been dealt. A look of unease fell on his brow as he glanced around the room. It seemed like all eyes in the bar were on him, having the same message written plain as day: ‚ÄúYou might win this hand, but you‚Äôll lose your life in the process.‚Äù As he slid a finger of his left hand into his pocket, the door cracked open with a blast.


‚ÄúTOBIAS! There y‚Äôare buddy! I been looking all over for ya!‚Äù


Graves clamored across the room without regard for any person ‚Äî or thing, for that matter ‚Äî in his way. The tension thickening the atmosphere seemed to catch fire. Some patrons scrambled away at the sign of Graves‚Äô gun, while others just embraced the familiar song and dance of Bilgewater‚Äôs daily life. Tobias felt the weight on his left shoulder shift. The hefty pirate turned to see Graves pointing his shotgun at his face.


‚ÄúMy friend and I here have some business to attend to, he can‚Äôt be stuck playin‚Äô some silly games here. I‚Äôd suggest you take him at his word when he says he‚Äôs gotta leave.‚Äù


As the other pirate turned to address the double-barreled problem in the room, Tobias‚Äô glowing eyes glanced out the window. The glow faded as he swiftly grabbed the sack of coins on the table and vanished, leaving a glowing red card in its place.


‚ÄúOh no, not the RED one again‚Ä¶ TOBIAAAAASSSS!‚Äù


Graves hastily ran back towards the door, leaving a trail of blue dust from his back pocket. The pirates lunged to grab him, but were blown off their feet by a explosion of magic at the table. Met by more men on the street, Graves loaded his gun with some extra powder for a boost in the opposite direction. A little extra smoke to help cover his tracks was a welcome side effect. As he rounded the corner, Tobias snatched a blue card from Graves‚Äô pocket as they ran out of town. The sound of the Serpentine River soon replaced the explosions and yelling the pair left behind.

‚Äî

‚ÄúOnly 30!? Hmph, some kind of partner you are‚Ä¶‚Äù


Graves‚Äô favorite card to play‚Ä¶ Always complaining about Tobias‚Äô workload compared to his.


‚ÄúOh come on, Malcolm, I did most of the work! You know how hard it is to make a bet like that with 400 pounds of murder on your shoulders!?‚Äù


‚ÄúImagine how heavy this gun is while runnin‚Äô away from them ‚Äò400 pounds‚Äô! You might be lucky, but I sure ain‚Äôt!‚Äù


‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ Maybe you‚Äôve got a point there, partner, but that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve got me for. We‚Äôll make it 31 percent.‚Äù


‚ÄúGrrrh‚Ä¶ Fine, but you‚Äôre buying dinner AND drinks next time we go into town!‚Äù


Tobias dropped a sack of gold coins in his partner‚Äôs lap, as he gently rubbed Malcom‚Äôs shoulders.


‚ÄúI always do, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù


They‚Äôd shared plenty of accomodations together; A tent by the river was more likely to be on the better half of places they‚Äôd ended up. Besides, Tobias always says home is where the heart is, and his heart‚Äôs wherever the money‚Äôs at. Settling down in one place was never in the cards for them.


The sun set further, leaving all but the slightest tinge of purple in the sky, fading into the greens and blues of the sea on the horizon. Tobias and Malcom laid together near the flickering fire. Tobias couldn‚Äôt get past an unsettling feeling, though. Malcolm tossed and turned a bit.


‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that smell? Smells like rotten fish guts‚Ä¶‚Äù


Malcolm leaned up, worrying it might be him, but Tobias knew what it was. He knew the riverside was never the safest place to be, as long as superstition is to be trusted. With the luck he has, he knew supersition had to have at least a little truth to it. With a bit of worry, he tossed on his coat and hat.


‚ÄúH-hey partner, I swear it isn‚Äôt me! Where are ya goin!?‚Äù
Tobias wasn‚Äôt listening to a single word out of his mouth.
‚ÄúMalcom, I‚Äôll be back. If I‚Äôm not, don‚Äôt look for me.‚Äù


His eyes glowed with that familiar blue magic, and Malcolm knew he wouldn‚Äôt find him if he tried. He sighed, and rolled back over.


‚ÄúI swear it ain‚Äôt me‚Ä¶‚Äù


‚Äî


Tobias walked about half a mile down the riverside, following the stench. As he grew closer, it began smelling more and more like food, a feast the likes of which he‚Äôd never thought possible‚Ä¶ At least not out in the middle of nowhere. He found tables stacked with various delicacies and cuisines, seemingly from all over Runeterra. As he‚Äôd guessed, a grotesquely overweight man - no. ‚Äúthing‚Äù - was perched in a luxurious chair in the center of the festivities, seeming to be the only one present. Slime dripped from every inch of his body, and his mouth nearly was as wide as Tobias was tall. Tobias had no doubt; He‚Äôd received an invitation to visit the River King, he just didn‚Äôt know why.


‚ÄúIt would appear our dinner guest has a-rrived! Please, my friend, take a seat. Anywhere you‚Äôd like.‚Äù


Tobias was still taking in the atmosphere, barely resisting the temptation to indulge in the River King‚Äôs comforts.


‚ÄúI prefer to stand, thanks. This is a bit of a strange place and time for such a feast, wouldn‚Äôt you say?‚Äù


‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs quite the opposite, my friend! Today‚Äôs a very special day.‚Äù


‚ÄúHm? What day would that be?‚Äù


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the day I make you the deal of the century, my friend! Anything you‚Äôve ever wanted, I‚Äôve got!‚Äù


‚ÄúAin‚Äôt nothin‚Äô you‚Äôve got I‚Äôm all too interested in, Mister‚Ä¶ Uh‚Ä¶‚Äù


Tobias scoured his memories, but only legends came to mind. Fables, stories from long ago of the River King Tahm Kench, a fiend who makes irresistible deals that always come with a price, and who always collects. The problem at hand, however, was that Tobias didn‚Äôt recall making a deal.


‚ÄúOh you WOUND me, my friend! You mean to say all those years of your life weren‚Äôt worth the bargain I gave you for them? Not even enough for a hint of kinship?‚Äù


The words ‚Äî or some latent magic hidden in them ‚Äî triggered a flood of memories behind Tobias‚Äô glowing eyes. His upbringing, his family, the guilt he felt when he got caught his first time, the anger he felt when his family and clan abandoned him‚Ä¶ Memories he knew were gone because of a foolish bet he once made. Memories he thought he‚Äôd be better without, except for the memory of the game he‚Äôd lost them on.


‚ÄúLook, I appreciate the thoughtful invitation Mr. uh‚Ä¶ Kench, but I really must go. I‚Äôve got a bit of a headache and I‚Äôd like to get some rest.‚Äù


‚ÄúCome now‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt get it Twisted, Fate. I know who you are, I know your game. I know your past, and you know my claim to fame. A bargain is due, and the River King always collects.‚Äù


The last syllable dragged itself for far too long in Tobias‚Äô mind. He finally remembered the bet wasn‚Äôt his memories on the line, Tobias wanted his memories gone. He wanted to live life without regrets‚Ä¶ He sought out the River King thinking he could make a deal and come out clean.


‚ÄúYou said I could take your regrets, and to give you 5 years to come up with some payment! Well, I‚Äôve still got these tasty memories, but I don‚Äôt have any payment, and it doesn‚Äôt look like you do either my friend.‚Äù


‚ÄúSorry, uh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been robbed blind! I‚Äôve got nothing to offer. Damn that Graves fellow‚Ä¶‚Äù


Tahm‚Äôs jaw began to unhinge and drip with drool.


‚ÄúWell then your life sounds like a tasty trade for my sublime services, wouldn‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù


Tobias wasn‚Äôt sure what was grumbling louder, Tahm Kench‚Äôs stomach or his voice.


‚ÄúTh-that‚Äôs a bit hasty of a negotiation there, wouldn‚Äôt you say? H-How about we make a game out of it? I‚Äôll bet my life if you win, but if I win I‚Äôll lose these memories for good. A draw splits the bet and we go back to 0. Deal?‚Äù


Tahm Kench lashed his tongue across the table, shoving everything onto the ground with a crash.


‚ÄúNOW we‚Äôre talking, my friend! I knew you couldn‚Äôt refuse the opportunites I had to offer! What game would best suit your mood?‚Äù


Tobias nervously began to pull a deck out of his pocket before Tahm spit one out onto the table. It was unsettlingly dry considering where it originated from, and seemed to be immune to the slime oozing from the River King‚Äôs hands as he shuffled.


‚ÄúUhhhh‚Ä¶ How about Poker? 5 hands. 100 marks each. Bilge rules?‚Äù


‚ÄúHm, I must say I‚Äôm very familiar with that game. Are you quite sure you think you can win? I don‚Äôt want a boring game, you see.‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty familiar myself, Mister Kench. Don‚Äôt patronize me.‚Äù


‚ÄúFear not, my friend! I make no assumption of your level of skill, and please‚Ä¶ Call me Tahm. Would you mind to cut the deck, my friend?‚Äù


‚ÄúGladly.‚Äù


The blue in Tobias‚Äô eyes faded for a split second as he made his cut.


‚Äî


Malcom‚Äôs sleep was uneasy. Something was up - Even if he did smell bad, it‚Äôs not like Tobias just to up-and-leave like that‚Ä¶ Was it something he said? Something he did? Maybe he should have just taken 30 percent‚Ä¶. Nah. He knows he‚Äôs worth more than that.


Still, the thought of Tobias‚Äô sudden departure made him restless. He sat up and saw a card glowing with a familiar blue tinge next to his shotgun.


‚ÄúShit, Tobias! I oughta kill you someday!‚Äù


Malcolm threw on some clothes, grabbed his gun and the glowing card, and held both out in front as he ventured along the river. He was never one to listen to Tobias‚Äô advice anyway. He swung around wildly, looking for the direction that would cause the card to glow brighter, then began sprinting in that direction.


‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just disappear on me! ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt look for me.‚Äô Pah! I don‚Äôt have to look for ya, you gave me a compass! I‚Äôm comin‚Äô, partner!‚Äù


‚Äî


‚ÄúListen, Mister Kench, this has been a wonderful exchange, and I must say you have been a fine competitor, but I‚Äôve never lost a fair game. It‚Äôs a personal rule of mine, and that rule‚Äôs not gonna be broken.‚Äù


Of course, Tobias knew this was less than a fair game, even by his standards. However, despite the odds, this was a game he could win without cheating. Bilge rules are‚Ä¶ open for interpretation anyway.


‚ÄúI do declare my friend, you as well have put up quite an entertaining opposition. However, it should be clear that I don‚Äôt play games for enjoyment, I play to wi- My word‚Ä¶ WHAT is that rancid STENCH?‚Äù


‚ÄúTOBIAS! WHAT‚ÄôS ALL THIS!? YOU CAME TO A PARTY WITHOUT ME? This food looks DELICIOUS!‚Äù


‚ÄúMalcol- NO! DON‚Äô-‚Äú


Tobias sighed as his partner took a bite of a turkey leg, unaware of the River King‚Äôs deception. Feeling that it tasted a bit fishier than it should, he spit it out, realising it was rotting fish remains rather than the feast he‚Äôd thought it was.


‚ÄúMy my, it seems your friend here is lacking some proper manners‚Ä¶‚Äù


Tahm rose from his seat and leaped into the air, vanishing with a splashing sound and reappearing from the ground behind Malcolm.


‚ÄúThough I suppose I could extend the niceties of an invitation! Would you like to join us? Feast as much as you‚Äôd like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just getting started!‚Äù


‚ÄúMalcolm! I told you I‚Äôd be BACK and absolutely NOT to LOOK FOR ME!‚Äù


‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt sleep, got bored. ‚ÄòSides, what‚Äôs the worst that could hap-AGHHHHH‚Äù


Malcolm turned to see Tahm Kench‚Äôs maw open wide, as Tahm prepared to swallow him whole. A flash of gold stopped his slithering tongue from finishing its loop around Malcolm‚Äôs body as Tobias yelled. Malcolm was still too shocked to hear what he was saying, but regained feeling in his legs in just enough time to start running.


‚ÄúBilge Rules, if either player leaves the table the game‚Äôs a draw! I believe we had a deal! It‚Äôs been a pleasure Mr. River King, but my ride has arrived, so I must bid you farewell!‚Äù


Graves dropped a smoke bomb to cover their escape. Tobias‚Äô head was pounding, struggling to acclimate itself to the memories and regrets finding their old home, but all things considered, the situation could be worse. They arrived back at their camp exhausted as the sun peeked over the horizon.


‚ÄúY‚Äôknow Malcolm, maybe I oughta give you that extra 19% anyway. I‚Äôm lucky I have someone as stupid as you by my side or that would have never worked. Thanks, partner.‚Äù

leagueoflegends,"this is my second take on Nasus's rework, the first one was stupid, how the did i thouth that by giving an execute on his Q would make for a good buff","My main objective were to delete his stat checker side and give him more skill expression
I gave him more ways to get stacks while also giving him actual rewards for stacking not just bonus damage, there might be a lot of text but that means his abilities are hard to explain on paper not that he has an overloaded kit, his bonus damage on stacks should be lowered down by 50%  since now his stacks are multidimensional not just raw damage and has more ways to stack them meaning he's going to be finishing a 40 min game with 800 stacks or so, I didn't mentioned numbers since those can we changed quite easily between patches


P
Soul Eater: removed
GRAND RESURRECTION
Every time a normal minion of his dies near him, Nasus can right-click on him to resurrect them in a Mummy, doing that will consume mana, those mummies will follow Nasus and heal him every 2 seconds, and the mummies will not be in sink so that it's more of a passive heal rather than a burst of heal every 2 seconds, and the mummies will make sure to stay behind Nasus( idk how to explain but they will stay behind Nasus but as close to their team nexus as well, so that if Nasus makes a turn they dont just start advancing towards the enemy nexus) if Nasus has 20(20 or something like 50, it depends on how easy Nasus can gain and keep the mummies alive) when he dies they will give their life to resurrect him

Q
SIPHONING STRIKE
Cast: Nasus enchants his next basic attack to deal bonus damage, hitting enemies will give him 2 stacks, small minions and monsters he kills will give 4 stacks and enemies, large minions and monsters will give 15, Nasus can also use Siphoning Strike on his mummies to gain 2 stacks, doing that to often however will scare away the rest of the mummies
The stacks will further empower Nasus's other abilities while also all of their damage will be scaled of half of the stacks
Upon reaching a sudden amount of stacks Siphoning Strike will gain bonus effects 
50 stacks: killing a unit with Siphoning Strike will reduce the cooldown by 50%
150 stacks: further increase the bonus range up to 50
300 stacks: while Nasus hit's an enemy with Siphoning Strike the attack will leave a mark on them that can be detonated by hitting them again with Siphoning Strike dealing percentage max health damage
600: after using Siphoning strike Nasus will gain a shield taht will block the next ability that hits him proctecing him of 50% of the danage and the CC taht ability caried
Cooldown: 5 seconds flat
Mana cost: 20 

W
WITHER
Cast: A skill shot with the range of 700 to 1000 (base on level) that comes from the back and goes towards Nasus, if it hits an enemy it will slow them for 30% up to 85% for 7 seconds, if Nasus kills the unit affected by Wither with Siphoning Strike Nasus gains twice as many stacks and a shield that scales based of the number of stacks Nasus has, the skill shot will go in Nasus direction and if it hits him Nasus gains bonus 30% up to 60%( based on level) movement speed
(can affect minions as well)
Cooldown: 16-15-14-13-12
Mana cost: 80 up to 100 

E
SPIRIT ABLAZE
cast: Nasus will start charging for up to 4 seconds, charging Spirit Ablaze will increase the radius, and range 300 radius plus 100 for each second, range 500 plus 100 for each second and mana cost 20 per second up to 40 per second of charging
Killing a unit in Sprit Ablaze will increase the duration from 4 seconds and 1-2 seconds based on level
Hitting an enemy with Wither while they are on Spirit Ablaze will instead root them for 1.5 seconds
Siphoning Strike will gain 50% armor penetration
Cooldown: 12 seconds 

R
NASUS'S RETALIATION 
Passive: PALACE OF DEATH AND REBIRTH
every minion that enters Nasus's base will deal 30% up to 60% less damage based on ability level, Nasus will gain twice as many stacks from them and Nasus's death time is cut in half
Cast: FURRY OF THE SANDS
upon activation, all of Nasus's abilities cooldowns are resets and he automatically gains 10 mummies, if Nasus uses Siphoning Strike on enemy champions they will carry Spirit Ablaze with them while Wither will pause the time he can keep Furry of the sands active if it hits him, Furry of the sands can stay active for 10 seconds and with Wither he can extend it by 5 seconds, in this form Nasus gains mr and armor based on the number of stacks he has
If he kills at least one enemy while in this form he gains Spirit Ablaze aura around him and slow resist
Cooldown: 140 seconds can be lowered with stacks",1652789878

Why play if you are not going to at least think about what somebody is typing or saying (ignoring obvious dumb stuff).

People are right and that you need to focus on your mistakes but you need to be active in responding to what your teammates are doing or trying to tell you.

I have had multiple games where a ping or a chat gets typed for a play or info and it just gets straight up ignored. 

I solo have baron buff, team has elder, and we win 5 v 5 so I ping to just group mid because we hard win fights. Adc goes bot jngl goes top to 1 3 1. Why? Game is over if we just aram with super minions we have?

Enemy top laner is 15% hp under tower but I am also about 30% hp, jngler is pathing top full hp bar. I ping the enemy laner for a dive because I have a decent size wave. My jungle goes to invade does enemy krugs then paths to scuttle and then mid. ????? What??

Have vision of top side camps they‚Äôre all empty, our jngler is top. I‚Äôm no detective but I‚Äôm pretty sure the enemy jngl is bot side. Ping bot to back off, take time to say xxxx is bot side, they die and then type ‚Äújngl diff‚Äù.

leagueoflegends,No problems with AFKs or trolls recently,"(Low plat elo btw)

I am curious because i read alot about people having afks or trolls in their team here. But i rarely get any of that in my games. Not on my team and not on the enemy team. I cant even remember the last time i had someone going intentionaly afk or just run down a lane to feed. I see someone like that every now and then, but i am sure that i saw less than 5 people this entire season that were actually inting by definition. i dodged 1 or 2 obvious trolls in champ select, dodged them and thats it. Even played against one of them the game after and he was actually a threat WITH his troll pick. they still lost due to the collateral damage he did on his teams mentality.

Sure, everyone gets bad teammates. Sometimes they are tilted and refuse to play as a team, but most of them join the fights eventually if your team can pull themselfs together and survive long enough.

You get a support that is good at engaging while you are to far behind to engage but they try to engage anyway.  You get the players that play dogshit that game cause they cant adept their playstyle. But i also had many games where these players become usefull if you just stall the game out. And if you cant come back? Your team got skill gapped. Happens to everyone. I could complain about questionable picks, but most of them actually try to win.  

Dont get me wrong, i will complain about a team thats loosing every lane. i had enough games were i press tab and gave up mentally. But its easy to see, if your team is getting skill gapped or trying to lose intentionaly. 

My biggest problem in ranked are smurfs and matchmaking. 

I cant blame my Gold 4 ADC for going  0/5 vs a plat 1 adc. Or my team getting destroyed by a lvl 34 kha jungle. You love to see your midlaner with a silver border in champ select. What does the enemy have to balance that? A silver Yuumi on a plat Kayn. 

Im someone who never mutes chat cause its entertaining most of the time. And i remember toxicity being very bad withing your own team. I still get the toxic teams frequently, but even in these games, nobody goes afk. They insult eachother to the very end but play it out. Ofc they perform worse when typing and being tilted but its better than going  afk. 

What i try to say is, that my games are more often decided by riots matchmaking algorythm than someone going afk/actually inting. The toxicity is still a part, but i see that enough on both sides. 

Is it elo related? am i just lucky? Or are you guys calling everyone a troll who has a bad game or got skill gapped and report them for it?",1652783524

leagueoflegends,Getting back into league - questions about the game regarding current meta and placements,"TL:DR at bottom, but I‚Äôd appreciate the read and some help!

Haven‚Äôt played league for a few years. I‚Äôve kept up so i understand the map changes, dragon changes, rift herald, objectives etc‚Ä¶ but haven‚Äôt actually played.

Let me preface by saying this: I‚Äôm awful. At my peak I was in plat, S5 I was gold, S2020(?) I was gold. I didn‚Äôt play then as much as I used to, so I have played the changes but I‚Äôm not overly familiar. It says now I‚Äôm in bronze, and I‚Äôm doing PITIFUL. Like 0/10, 2/9, 1/12 type performances. Awful, game losing, my lanes too fat type of play.

When I used to play (from launch till about Tahm Kench release) I played exclusively ADC (back when you had to type your roll as fast as possible) when supports were your typical Blitz, Taric, Thresh etc‚Ä¶

I tried playing ADC again, I‚Äôm fucking awful. One thing I‚Äôve noticed is nobody picks a support I actually consider a support champ, so rather than the sit back - farm, drop a ward and when your support makes a pull/they overextend/gank to fight, it‚Äôs a constant poke battle and an MF/Azir/Veigar support doesn‚Äôt help me with survivability in this instance. So I packed it up, I don‚Äôt enjoy the current ADC climate - and I moved to top. This is where I was most recently getting gold, playing only trynd/nasus. 

I think I‚Äôve played even worse top. I‚Äôve noticed I lose early pressure, then get sat under tower and lose lane so hard I can‚Äôt even sit under tower anymore. I‚Äôm just shocked as‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in bronze. Last time I was in bronze was when graves was an ADC and elo was just a number.

Did I just become extraordinarily shit, or did league evolve and become much tougher? I‚Äôm still in my placements and I haven‚Äôt strung even one decent game together, where I used to be able to solo carry gold 2/1 games playing top.

Is there anything I should be trying to do/look out for/remember in particular as an old returning player?

TL:DR; I used to be ‚Äúdecent‚Äù now I‚Äôm absolutely awful. What should I be looking out for, and are placement games now just way more difficult?",1652783513

leagueoflegends,Baron or Elder ?,"Which do you think should players prioritize? Some would definitely pick without thinking that elder is better than baron but I think baron buff is so op in late game. Yes, you could argue that elder gives you buff that is permanent but we should account that after getting this, the game only last for like what? 2-5 mins? Knowing that in late game it's a matter of a death or two that decides the winner, this just makes baron buff better since when someone dies pushing through the enemy's base will be much more easier since it will enhance your creeps and makes your pushing more powerful and  the enemies elder buff useless considering the tankiness of the creeps due to the buff from baron. I mean it's so agonizing when the enemy has a baron buff in later stage of the game, it's inevitable that you'll lose due to the non-stop surge of minions onto your base like wtf. So what are your thoughts about this, and what do you think should be prioritized first?",1652782375

leagueoflegends,Dynamic Queue vs SoloQ + FlexQ,"Guys, ever since they removed Dynamic Queue, I always wanted to get it back because it was literally better for the game. In Diamond + You lose many games because of people running you down for almost no reason and toxicity is a big thing in league anyways, dynamic queue could mostly fix both of these things like it did back in season 6 but I remember reddit posts of gold and silver players complaining that they want SoloQ back. Why would we ever want soloq back? SoloQ IN A TEAM GAME MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL  


Most of us DREAM of ever getting into a pro team or whatever but soloq doesnt even prepare us for this, even if we are Challenger, we arent ready to play competetively at all, Soloq only has downsides in comparison to dynamic queue, now evne more than ever. Back in season 6 you could 1v9 a lot harder, nowdays the game was balanced extremely towards teamplay, so why do we still have soloq?  


Also it makes no sense to have 2 ranked queues for the same mode, flexq is mostly ""normal game with lp"" to most people

I'm not hating on him, i just don't understand how simple, full un-edited videos of fun builds in silver norms consistently get 150-200k+ views.  
I see the beginner attraction, as i started watching Zwag in Season 10 when i was relatively new as well; the fun content caught my eye.  
 However, this type of content usually dies off after a year or so when ideas eventually run out, which they have for Zwag, and yet he still trumps his last videos' views every upload - even when he revisits old ideas.

It's just so mind-boggling to me to see all these Challenger content-creators that have to bust their asses daily against real players, AND edit (or have edited) their videos only to get 10% of his views.

I‚Äôve read I should be aiming for 8-10 CS/min. I‚Äôm currently consistently at 4.6/min even if I‚Äôm the only player in the lane, which I don‚Äôt understand. If I‚Äôm the only one killing minions, where‚Äôs the rest of the CS? I‚Äôve tried this a 1 v 1 against Tristana as a test as well, with basically the same result.

Looking at my data, I am almost double average Jinx players for ‚Äúearly CS advantage‚Äù at -1.0 vs -1.8, but in total CS I‚Äôm roughly about 1/4 of the average. So I‚Äôm starting off strong and then‚Ä¶ what?

Finally, the main problem: farming under the tower.

Everything I read advices the ADC to farm under the tower under pressure. Okay, so if I‚Äôm already only getting half the CS and now I‚Äôm waiting until half the wave is killed before it gets to me, isn‚Äôt that just going to cut my CS to like 2-3/min?

Also this is absolutely not an answer to the Jhin/Caitlyn or Jhin/Morgana pairings I‚Äôve a lot seen lately.

leagueoflegends,League is a 1999 game,"I really have been thinking about this, and League is a 1999 game:  


1-1999 stats and ranking: The most team focused game that lets you believe that solo performance is the key: league is probably one of the most team strategy game ever. But to climb the ladder and establish your worth, you have to play solo queue. This is so misleading... Everyone wants to carry the team. Everyone establishes their worth according to their solo rank. But in the end, you get selfish players that school everyone, thinking they are good because their micro is good, but their macro sucks.  
2-Cluncky 1999 controls: everything is on the mouse. Move camera: mouse. Attack: mouse. Spells: mouse. This game is DESIGNED to give you carpentunnel syndrom (i am surprised nobody sued them yet). It is a mouse destroyer. 20 thousand clicks per minute. I look at my friends play, and their mouse basically goes for 10 kms per game. Tap on the edge of the screen to move camera, then come back to last hit, then move back to click move the champion, then move in front to do a spell, then tap screen to move the cam, then move mouse to click attack the ennemy champion... repeat. Seriously, you really can't streamline this shit in 2022? I don't understand.  
3-A 1999 2D laggy game: C'mon, 10 players, a 2D engine, no crazy physics, nothing fancy! And your client still manages to crash? Still manages to do major drop frames every 10 seconds? Still get lags every once in a while? Jesus, i played Dune 2 on my AMiga in 1989 and it was less laggy.  
4-1999 communication: Voice chat? Nooo. Lets just do it the old way: text chat! Yep. That is the only way you can actually try to communicate. Oh, sorry, I forgot pings. Yes, pings. So intuitive and so clear. Basically, the chat is just a troll and toxic fest of players who curse at each other. And the pings are basically a non sens of player agressiveness. It's like trying to understand second degree communication with your girlfriend! Is she pinging to tell me to go there, or not go there. Is she mad? Is she trying to tell me something?  
5-1999 matchmaking system: lets put 5 support together and let them play all positions. Like if you where playing hockey with  6 goaltenders, asking them to go offense. Why not put all the best players in one team, and all the shitty players in another? Lets also create a honor system that doesn't do anything except give you little esthetic bonuses. Oh, and lets not punish any toxic behavior. And lets not punish smurfs, because... they really don't do damage to the fun factor of the game. Lets wait until someone basically destroyed the game for hundreds of players before sending them a warning. Why not use the honor system to pit dishonorable players together and honorable players together? NAAH, that is too much of a good idea.  


I will stop here, I feel I have given enough fuel to Reddit League of Legends to bash me for centuries.  


So go at it friends! Let me know how I don't understand anything... let me know how stupid I am! Bring the god of Reddit Social Justice Warriors upon theeee!",1652761465
leagueoflegends,Will they ever bring ascension back?,One of the best game modes they released in my opinion. I just wanna be ascended with jhin. This is my formal complaint.,1652760996
leagueoflegends,Should Champion Bounties be so Volatile?,"When you kill a champion with a bounty the person who last hits the kill gets all of the bounty. The assist bounty does not change at all (not that it should). The result though is that making sure the right person gets the last hit on somebody with a 1k bounty is both very important and extremely volatile.

A game can be 25-10 and be SUPER winnable, all you have to do is collect every bounty 1 time and most of the time the gold difference becomes marginal. However, that super winnable game becomes literally unwinnable if the supports ignite last hits the 1k bounty. That doesn't feel like intended gameplay. I don't think anybody at Riot is thinking ""gg noobs should have thought of that before you pressed ignite on the low hp irelia.""

Obviously the problem exists with normal kills too, but 300 gold to 150 is small enough that you can kind of ignore it. A thousand gold is just too big of a swing for the player it ends up to be so random imo.

Would it be the end of the world if they just made it so that if you own a support item and get a shutdown the bounty is split between players who assisted? Core gameplay would hardly change. You would even still be able to int your bounties to supports by just getting hit and running under a tower as long as nobody else gets an assists. Games would just feel slightly less random and I think that would be for the better.",1652760910
leagueoflegends,New Swain Rework Incredibly Toxic,"Let's be honest here. Most of us aren't on the level that's being balanced around. I get it. At the same time, we can all enjoy the game without a lane innocuously throwing it at 3 minutes by virtue of an early death.   


Enter Swain's rework's rework, because if Riot can't settle on anything, it's not settling on a champ design. The problem? Every bad aspect of that kit was amplified. It's now easier. It's now tankier. It's now healier. Why?  


For what purpose? Not for us. Mage default items already give a shitton of health anyway. So, why? Why this double down on the birds? The ease? Cheap plays. Need I say more?",1652760661

leagueoflegends,What confuses me the most about the game is its autofill system. Who looked at this idea and thought this is a fun mechanic to have in the game and decides to keep this for years?," The concept of autofill doesn't make any sense when you think about it, and those who defend it absolutely baffle me.

Selecting your role is basically ordering at a fast-food restaurant called League of Legends. You requested a burger and told them to give you a wrap instead if they run out of burgers. Normally you would expect the restaurant just to give you burgers, and on extremely rare occasions when they run out of burgers, they give you wraps.

Then, the restaurant gives you some god damn jungle coleslaw that nobody orders at a fucking fast food restaurant.

Instead of apologizing, they tell you that a salad was given to you so other people can get their wraps and burgers faster.

Normally this would be unacceptable. However, this fast-food restaurant has bouncers who shove a gun up your ass and promises to pull the trigger if you leave without finishing the god damn salad.

This is basically the autofill system in a nutshell. Tell me if you are the customer ordering at a fast-food restaurant. Would you rather wait 10 minutes for a burger, or wait 20 seconds for a coleslaw? If all the customer hates the coleslaw and you can't remove this from the menu, then why not make the coleslaw tastier so more people would order it instead of causing a burger/wrap shortage?

Riot, why not make every role fun?",1652759576

leagueoflegends,Is ARURF becoming even burstier than it already was?," Most URF's and ARURF's I've played, there is a lot of burst. It comes with the mode. But most of the time there still was some semblance of trading in lane, and while many champs were annoying most were bearable if you were good enough. There was a fair amount of snowballing, but I always remember it being very enjoyable.

This time around it's like every single fight is a 100-0. If your champ has either burst and a dash, or burst and a movespeed steroid you just win. The only exception maybe being tank veigar. I am constantly getting bursted by the likes of AP zilean and karma, while not being able to get close even on champions who are normally considered manoeuvrable or fast champions. People with dashes just run rings around everyone. Every game is incredibly one sided, with whoever gets an early lead being pretty much guaranteed to win. Previous games I could dominate most people, even the most broken URF champs on Aurelion Sol. This time the only reason why I didn't become totally irrelevant in the one game i got lucky enough to get him was because I really tried to play well, and farm jungle/lanes my fed opponent was not near so I could get gold and XP. Still doesn't matter because I can't position when the enemy team is always faster than me or just dashing everywhere.

It's like every game now I'm either sat under tower trying not to die to my laner, or sat under tower trying not to attract attention from one of my ally's fed laner. And then theres one game where I manage to get turbo fed and pretty much am unbeatable, out of like seven or eight games I felt like I had barely any impact on anything.",1652754584

leagueoflegends,Cheese team comps for your next Clash session with friends,"Hi! I'm that one wannabe analyst that comes in and out of the subreddit making random suggestions to no one who asks for it. Kind of like that teammate in a ranked game telling you how to play your main champ. Anyway here are some team comps to play for your next Clash game with your friends. 

Team Comp #1
THAT. GIRL. IS. POISON!

Team comp. Cassiopea, Shaco, Teemo, Singe, Twitch

Did you know that Cass's twin fangs can get its bonus effect off any poison in the game? You can flex this team comp around for the most part. However, the mechanically best player on your team has to be on Cassiopea. She is hard to play well and is the real carry of the team. Twitch is just there as a backup in case your Cass ~~sucks~~ ~~feeds~~ dies too early.

Traditional Positions on the comp-

Top: Singe

Jungle: Shaco

Mid: Cass

Bot: Twitch

Support: Teemo


Non Traditional Positions for this comp(flex due to a bad matchup): 

Top: Shaco

Jungle: Twitch

Mid: Teemo

Bot: Cass

Support: Singe

Team Comp#2 

TFT Glacial Comp 

Team Comp: Anivia, Ashe, Braum, Volibear, Nunu

Slows are strong. Good kiting, good zoning. Good disengage. Good Engage. This is a well-rounded comp. It's just funny that they are all frejlord. 

Traditional positions are preferred on this composition, but you can sub out Nunu for Sejuani, and Volibear for Olaf if needed or to flex. All of which are valid options and maintain the Frejlord theme. 

Traditional Positions: 

Top: Volibear

Jungle: Nunu

Mid: Anivia

Bot: Ashe

Support: Braum

Team Comp #3

Supports are OP

Team Comp: Senna, Seraphine, Taric, Shen, Ivern

All of these champs can be in the support position. The only question you should be asking is who is the brave jungler since there is the obvious Ivern, the intelligent Shen, and the enlightened Taric jungle options. In all options you want Senna to be playing the fasting style since she scales very well without a lot of initial gold. If you don't know what fasting Senna is please look it up. 

Traditional Composition: 

Top: Shen

Jungle: Ivern

Mid: Seraphine

Bot: Senna

Support: Taric

Intelligent Composition: 

Top: Ivern

Jungle: Shen

Mid: Seraphine 

Bot: Senna

Support: Taric

Enlightened Composition: 

Top: Shen

Jungle: Taric 

Mid: Ivern

Bot: Senna

Support: Seraphine


Team Comp #4

Gotta go Fast

Team comp: Janna, Sivir, Zilean, Karma, Olaf

Just rotating around the map at the speed of sound on the rift. Honestly only added in Olaf because he benefits from all of the speed given on this team(and is the best viable jungler for this type of composition), but if you want even more team-wide speed. Trade him out for Kled. No one will ever out rotate you with this team. 

Traditional Composition:

leagueoflegends,Noob question regarding positioning,"Showing interest in the game, and something that I need explained.

So, I understand that fighters/tanks typically go top, assassins go jungle, mages go mid, supports and marksmen duo bottom (though that's not always the case, of course). That, pretty easy to wrap my brain around.

However, I'm not exactly understanding why. Like, assassins going Jungle, I somewhat understand without even seeing how assassins play. You'd figure that assassins would stick to shadows, which means the Jungle would be perfect for them, that makes sense.  
Marksmen and Supports sticking together? Yeah, that also makes sense, since Marksmen seem to need time to level up, and supports can keep the marksman safe during that time. Totally understandable.

But outside of that, I'm not understanding positioning. Why do duelist/brawler characters go top specifically? Why do mages go mid? Why is bottom best for the marksman and support duo? Does it have to do with minion spawns, jungle spawns, or turret health? Are any of those even factors?",1652746688

I feel bad for the ADCs and squishy mages getting one shotted and stomp by a full AP malphite and chogath and at the same time literally tanking everything.

They should lower the AP percentage of their skills and add HP scaling to make it more balance and for players to carefully decide their decisions either getting full tank build with decent amount of damage or full glass canon with less durability.",1652746184

leagueoflegends,"I've been playing ADC more, I win my lane and have the most kills or turret damage on my team, but how do I deal with people feeding bruisers?","I used to play support a lot, but I played a few ADC's in ARAM and saw how fun they were. I started taking them into summoners rift but my winrate is lower now. I know I'm not perfect, but when I play ADC I win my lane and have much more CS than our opponents. I am always looking where the enemy jungle or mid lane is so I can avoid easy ganks. 

But I feel SO useless if the rest of my team feeds champs that can take me out in one or two hits. I am genuinely curious what I'm supposed to do. My favorite ADC is caitlynn if that adds anything. I get a random support and we rock it bot lane, but as soon as top, mid, jg enemy get fed they come for me. I really don't know. 

I'd appreciate any advice. I would play support because it was so easy to keep my ADC alive and even deal more damage than them and secure kills for them. Playing ADC, my supports don't keep me alive  and it feels like a weird 2v1 thing sometimes. I can handle that whatever. But I can't handle when 10 kill fed top bruiser focuses me and then kills me with one swipe. 

So yall, what do you do in this situation? I'm loving the ADC role but it weirdly feels more reliant on the team than a support would. I could carry as a support if my team sucked, I can't carry as an adc if my team doesn't have my back. So I'm clueless",1652745856

Because of this, if a legacy skin was released for a champ that only had 1 skin, the legacy skin would be available until their next release. One example of this is Bard. Elderwood was his release skin and Snow Day (legacy) was his second skin but it stayed available long after the holidays until he got another skin.    

Aphelios has his release skin (Nightbringer) and 2 legacy skins: Lunar Beast and EDG. So why isn't Lunar Beast still in the shop? Once EDG goes away in 2 weeks he will go back to having just 1 skin.

leagueoflegends,Another response to MSI Format (per JLXP feat. Jatt/Markz),"This is my response to the questions by Markz and Jatt about potential changes to the MSI format to respond to critiques.  I apologize for grammar ahead of time as this has been a somewhat stream of consciousness. 

Jatt and Markz mentioned the following constraints when formatting MSI, so we'll try and consider these when proposing the format:

14 days of league broadcast

Not reducing viewership (highlighting past IWC)

&amp;#x200B;

Before looking at potential format options it is important to both consider the current critiques (areas to be improved by format change), and different trade-offs of MSI.

**Critiques of current format:**

**1)  Too many low-stakes games.**  I define a low-stakes game as a game that does not have a significant impact on the greater scheme of the tournament.  These include games played after teams moving on have been decided, as well as games in which the outcome is almost certain, ie. games between minor regions and contenders ie. EU, CN, KR 1 seeds.

**2)  Low competitive quality**, as a result of not enough representation of major regions given only two international tournaments a year.  Outside of worlds, we only get to see major region clashes in competitive riot events twice a year.  Only sending one team from the major regions provides a lackluster tournament in terms of competition as there are typically only 2 heavy favorites (KR CN 1st seeds), with one outside favorite (EU 1st seed).  Hosting a tournament that features 12 teams, but typically only 2-3 teams have a &gt;5% chance of winning does not provide a good competitive tournament and creates too many low-stakes games as mentioned above. 

Typically, when looking at other bracket tournaments like the NCAAM/NCAAW march madness tournaments, teams can generally be broken down into various tiers, the ones we‚Äôll focus on include:

Favorites: Teams in which not winning is an underperformance.

Contenders: Teams that have a low, but realistic chance of winning.

Dark Horses: Teams that can upset contenders and over-perform expectations.

Representatives: These are typically your 13-16 seeds, which have little chance to do any damage in the tournament, but offer a chance for smaller conferences to get exposure.  Typically this is around 25% of the field, these teams can occasionally make a few upsets, but typically don‚Äôt get very far. 

Currently, the majority of teams at MSI fall into the Representatives category, with a few of the regions playing dark horses, and there are almost no contenders outside of EU 1 seed.  Ideally, we would want almost an equal breakdown of these categories to provide for a more interesting/competitive tournament. 

This critique was especially brought to light this year, with RNG‚Äôs travel situation.  Many considered the tournament not worthwhile if RNG could not play in the tournament, because that would remove one of the two tournament favorites, leaving only 1 favorite and 1 contender.

**MSI Trade-Offs:**

1) International Minor Region Representation

2) Average/Peak Viewership

3) Competitive Quality of Matches (Average/Peak)

Currently, the MSI format weights the tradeoffs in the following manner

Representation &gt; Viewership &gt; Competitive Quality

However, despite providing minor region teams with representation and the opportunity to play against the best in the world, they are forced into primarily low-stakes games and do not have a good chance to progress into the tournament.  Then we have to ask the question, is this the best form of representation for these minor region teams, and is this representation worth the tradeoffs of lower viewership and lower competitive quality of the tournament in general?  

I am not trying to be a minor region hater, but I would argue no, it is not in its current state.  Later on, we‚Äôll look into how we can retain/improve minor region representation with high-stakes minor region games.

**Proposed MSI changes:**

For the proposed MSI changes we are looking to prioritize the following trade-offs in this manner

Competitive Quality = Viewership &gt; Representation

By doing this, we are increasing the number of high-stakes games, and increasing the number of favorites/contenders to roughly half of the field (Multiple KR seeds, Multiple CN seeds, EU 1 seed).  Additionally, we add more dark horses (NA 1-2 seeds, EU 2 seed, VCS 1 seed, PCS 1 seed, Minor Region 1 seed).  This is also important, because then the games between the non-contenders and contenders, will have a significant impact, making them high-stakes games, which leads to increased viewership.  We will be left with relatively few low-stakes games, typically between the non-contenders and favorites, which likely do not play a major effect on tournament results, but we move from a group stage where the majority of games are low-stakes, to a majority of games that are high-stakes.

**Stage 1: Group Round Robin Stage**

2 groups of 6 teams selected from different pools

1 pool 1a, 1 pool 1b, 2 pool 2, 2 pool 3 teams per group

**Pool 1a** 

World‚Äôs winner (we will assume CN/KR) Seed 1

Non World‚Äôs winner (of CN/KR) Seed 1

**Pool 1b**

World‚Äôs winner Seed 2

EU seed 1

**Pool 2**

World‚Äôs winner Seed 3

Non World‚Äôs winner (of CN/KR) Seed 2

EU seed 2

NA seed 1

**Pool 3**

Minor Region seed 1

NA seed 2

VCS seed 1

PCS seed 1

(Note, this was just an example, but there could be rules to how teams move up/down in the pools based on performance, similar to worlds).

Overall, the region winning worlds will send the top 3 teams, the other 3 major regions will send 2 teams each, PCS, VCS and the IWC winner will each send 1 team.

Each group will play a double round-robin, with the top 4 teams in each group advancing.  

**Stage 2: Bracket Stage** (Single or Double Elim)

The groups will then be seeded into a standard single-elimination quarterfinal bracket, or a winners/losers double-elimination bracket as stated below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s3otz1t22xz81.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2660af34e99a879c64eef4cf46c96c9303a41a7a

Total broadcast time for single elimination bracket stage: 7 days of group stage (7 games/day, one day of 8), 7 days quarterfinals, 14 total.

Double elim: 17 total days (3 additional B of 5‚Äôs)

**Results of format changes:**

Given the increase in high stakes games and increased regional representatives, from the largest viewing regions (CN, KR, EU) including increased fanbase representation, we would expect that the tournament would receive much larger viewership than the current format.  This is supported by worlds viewership, which tends to be higher among games of CN vs KR, CN vs. EU, KR vs. EU.  

The tournament would also be more competitively exciting as more teams would be considered contenders for the title, and it wouldn't come down to an eventual KR vs CN final (unless EU upsets).

Additionally, these changes are positive in terms of major region leagues, primarily NA and EU, as it gives greater incentive to the middle of the back and bottom teams to improve rosters as there is a chance for international competition even when placing 2nd regionally.  

**Minor Regions in this Format:**

The clear downfall of this format is that few to no minor regions are represented.  In my opinion, this is okay, as the current format doesn't really offer much for the minor region teams.  They occasionally upset the Pool 3 teams listed above, but typically show up to MSI, play almost no high-stakes games and then leave after the group stage.  While it may be exciting to send a team from the minor regions, getting destroyed in a 25-minute game vs T1 or RNG is not a very rewarding experience for the minor region team players or fans and this inclusivity isn‚Äôt really achieving what it sets out to be.  

It is true that viewership between teams like T1 and RNG vs minor teams is typically higher than minor region vs minor region, but this is partially due to the fact that many of the viewers are in fact coming from CN and KR (although I cannot substantiate this with data).

Tournaments like EU masters have proved that it is possible to have a tournament featuring non-top region teams and have high-stakes matches as well as great viewership and it would be in better interest to have a tournament among the minor regions to try and emulate this.  

Having a smaller region tournament each year, whether around MSI time period or as part of All Stars, would be a proper way to have the minor regions have high-stakes competitive games against each other, with the winner of the tournament being invited to next year‚Äôs MSI as the minor region representative and it will be a good gage of upcoming regions which could follow in the footsteps of regions like VCS and cement themselves apart from the rest of the smaller regions as they show their dominance.

Now I know, most people will bring the international wildcard tournaments which used to preface MSI and had low viewership, but I would hope that regional pride would be enough for fans to support their region in a more competitive tournament in which the teams can play many more games on more even footings and create and renew minor region rivalries.  As a fan of lesser-known regions, I would find this much more interesting to watch than my team going to MSI, getting absolutely blasted, and leaving after a short time.  If this event was part of All-Stars, it might be a way to bring more international viewership from the major regions, and it would be cool if they had players/personalities from the major regions involved in casting (maybe tri-casts with casters) and analyst desk, player interviews and integrated them within the tournament.  This would be a cool way to further propel all-star players from major regions' personalities and popularity, as well as use their viewership/following to shine a light on the minor region tournament.  They could also have segments with analysts, like Tim Sevenhyusen or the LCS/LEC analysts focused on scouting players from minor regions.  Maybe this is a big ask, but it could be fun.

Overall, this format change would certainly increase the cost to riot (so I definitely cheated a bit, according to the stakes set forth by Mark and Jatt), as they would have to host/integrate another smaller minor region tournament, which likely has reduced viewership, but it would be offset by much greater MSI viewership and interest.  However, if the tradeoff to have a better, more competitive MSI isn‚Äôt worth the cost increase, then overall it is a pretty rough outlook for Riot‚Äôs commitment to international tournaments.  Also, by adding 3 days to the tournament, they could try double elim in an international tournament for the first time, something requested by both teams and fans alike.

I am interested in the thoughts of fans of minor regions and whether this type of change would be a positive or negative for their experience.",1652741547

leagueoflegends,Pantheon deserves an Aspect of War Legendary skin,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hnju647knwz81.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee3ba90bdab5ac3325e888fc4ac98ad148ca583e

From Pantheon's bio:

&gt;Judging Atreus unworthy, a warrior who had known only defeat, it had taken control of his body to pursue its own ends‚Äîa task it considered too great for mortal men. 

This line from Panth's bio summarizes Pantheon's 2016 lore rewrite which introduced the characters of Atreus and the Aspect of War, ""Pantheon"", to the lore.   
For the period 2016-2019 the Aspect of War was the champion you would play as in LoL, despite no visual changes to the character model. The voice lines of several champions also acknowledged that the champion Pantheon was in fact the Aspect of War.

Similarly within the lore, the Aspect of War spent numerous years in possession of Atreus' body influencing Runeterra. Specifically the task it deemed to great for mortal men, subjugating the Darkin.

From Panth's bio:

&gt;Cast into the furthest corners of his own mind, Atreus endured only vague visions as the Aspect scoured the world for Darkin, living weapons created in a bygone age. 

This is pursuit of the Darkin lead the Aspect of War to engage Aatrox in battle which ultimately resulted in its death, hence freeing Atreus.   
Any Aatrox and Pantheon enjoyer, will tell you that the battle between Aatrox and the Aspect of War and the subsequent Aatrox vs Atreus battle is a story they hope to see told in it's entirety.

However, Aatrox is far from the only Darkin the Aspect of War would have encountered during his time on Runeterra.   
Of the 2 remaining Darkin on the roster Rhaast has vague origins even Kayn's lore, which makes him a prime candidate to have encountered the Aspect of War during this period and most likely any future Darkin, will also be connected to the Aspect of War.

These reasons are what makes the Aspect of War an important character to Pantheon as a champion in LoL and why he deserves to be a skin.

Well, i am not like that, i understand that we are losing and try to do something to win, and if we can't it's fine. I don't run it down, i try to play smartly and look for the right play... So, i think i am a genuine player, someone who rarely causes the loss, compared to people that just wants to lose the game because they can't deal with what i mentioned. I have met several players like me, and playing adc, if i find a support who has this mindset, i feel so happy. So by sending friend requests, i built a very nice community, i always have good friends to play with, and i have a lot of fun, even when losing. That's why i play a lot of flex, it's amazing to play with people you respect and you trust. But of course, soloqueue is different. So i was wondering, isn't there a way for riot to put together toxic players with toxic players, and genuine players with genuine ones? I mean, i know it's hard for the system to understand if someone is genuine or toxic, i know that it would require more queuing time, but really, it would be so much nicer and more enjoyable. Toxic players would consume each other by playing in a separate queue, while people who really want to play to improve, who feels passionate for this beautiful game, would be rewarded. Is it so impossible to build such a system?",1652736774

Only 0.9% of players achieved this. And the list goes on... I mean only 0.9% of the whole player base manage to complete the quest faster than 60s compared to the enemy? So whats the actual % of the support players from the whole player base?

leagueoflegends,part 3 of 3 champion Idea (Mask Bearer),"This is a part 3 of 3, covering the mask bearer Champ. This can be either regarded as 2 of the 6 masks for one Champion or a champion out a trio of mask bearers. This mask bearer would focus predominantly upon AP related builds due to there being a Burst and Enchanter mask.



Burst Mage, the spirit of a vengeful Mage either from Icathia, Valoran or Demacia. If they go down the route of Icathia, they will be bloodthirsty lore wise towards the void, Valoran would be to murder Mordekaiser for bashing them up and Demacia would be a spirit wanting to witness Sylas being executed for outing their powers as a Mage, eventually recieving the death penalty from the government because of Sylas if they wanted to tie both Demacia and either Icathia or Valoran, they could go the route that they were a Demacian refugee. If they went under this form of lore, the mask would have a blue Mist like freckles with a Blue Elipse Pattern, both being in reference to the the Champion's spells.
Due to the magic spells having a fair amount of Damage on Time spells, an alternative lore wise would be an individual running a Zaun Syndicate that would steal Hextech crystals for power in addition to creating lethal corrosive chemicals, eventually dying to Renata with Renata taking some of the chemical formulas with her. The mask with this underground individual would be a green Mist like pattern all over the mask.

Q: the lock spell shoots off 2 spells with a curve like path similar to a Galio Tornado (an elipse path with 2 projectiles); however, there are multiple things that can happen. If 2 enemies are in front of the shot, both get locked. If 1 enemy recieves both shots, the Burst damage is doubled compared to 1 Burst shot. In lore, Sylas used the soul's R followed by a Q against them when they tried to run away from the Demacian authorities if they go down the Demacian route, soul wise. The shot could look Water like, similar to a water bender from Avatar or could glow a ghostly Teal to fit the dead theme. If they went down the Zaun path, they could either go with the Teal color theme or a dark blue to resemble Hextech energy.

W: the ground explodes upwards in a similar manner to Vel'Koz's stun, leaving temporary magic terrain that deals damage and slows the enemy, similar to a Morgana terrain spell. The design of the spell would look like a geyser, popping the enemy upwards, spewing hot water. If they when down the Zaun route, the ability would be certainly different, being a chemical bomb that is slid below the feet, similar to a Lux Burst followed by the explosion similar to a Ziggs C4.

E: the Mage sprays enemies at a close range with a mist that slows enemies and does a bit of Damage on Time (like a poison or burn). If they went down the Zaun route, it would be the same thing

R: the ultimate summons a foggy Mist similar to a Renata ult. The catch is that enemies within the Mist have a lack of vision, slowed down in a similar manner to Casseopia's poison puddles, preventing flashes while also taking Damage over Time (similar to a poison. Think of it like corrosive magic where the mage's heated temper makes their water spells become more acidic). This Mist would've been used lore wise in a few instances. One instance would've been to escape their crippling magic city (Icathia or Valoran) while the other instances would've been to evade Demacian authorities, eventually pulling Sylas into the investigation pre-lockup. Alternatively, if they went down the Zaun path regarding lore, the Mage would've triggered by a ghastly device





Enchanter's Mask, the soul of an innocent loving soul, either originating from Ionia or Demacia. This individual once tended to the wounds of the dying, using their magic for good. If they went down the Demacian route, they would've healed dying mages in the underground, eventually being confronted by Sylas and executed by the demacian government. If they went down the Ionian route, she would've died at the hands of Noxians pillaging Ionian villages (they could also potentially add some emotionally traumatic stuff to the lore to further emphasize the vile behavior of the Noxian army but that can also be regarded as too dark or too insensitive to some). The mask would have a wave like pattern on one eye and a circle on the other eye. The wave creeping upwards near the cheekbone, moving to the side of the eye, in reference to the potions and healing items at her belt with the circle being in reference to her magic enchantment spells.

Q: a skill shot used to apply anti healing effects, slowing the enemy in the process.

W: the masked healer bandages their ally beside them. When the spell is channeled, the support follows the ally that they're healing, locked on until the channel is either broken or fully completed

E: the masked support has a spell that undos Crowd Control effects in their surrounding radius

R: people within the ult's radius recieve healing, similar to a Janna ult with no pushback on enemies yet also applies a buff to those that stick within the radius",1652732981

leagueoflegends,Part 2 of 3 (Mask Bearer),"This is a continuation of a Champion Idea (though could also be easily applied as an independent Champ as well). This part covers a mask bearer with an Assassin and a Marksman (specifically a drowned Pirate) both can build either AD or AP to whoever it suits. This idea could be seen as a continuation of the part 1 or it could be regarded as another champion tied to a trio of people who use masks that bear the souls of the dead.



Assassin Mask, the soul of a former high tier assassin, betrayed by all of the members in their group, stabbing them like Julius Caesar. This assassin would likely have their origins in either Noxus or Bilgewater. The mask would have an X like design. This mask instantly acts as an alternative to Smite, granting the Assassin to either engrain the Frost or Burst Smite magic into the mask (Blue X for frost, Red X for Burst. Neither are visually noticeable on the model of the Assassin's mask because the X in game is a Black color).

Q: gives the mask bearer the ability to throw daggers in a similar manner to Shaco, slowing the enemy. The catch is, the dagger is attached to the enemy so if you hit the enemy again, you're able to use the ability again similar to a Katarina and an Olaf fused with a Senna (I say Senna because if you damage an opponent, attacking the enemy again helps stack on the infinite soul stacks).

W: this ability initiates a cloak similar to Twitch where if the mask bearer successfully assassinates someone, they are able to reuse the ability and cloak again. The cloak would be however similar to shaco to allow for up close ganks rather than Twitch or Evelynn where you're still able to see them up close.

E: the Assassin uses a Lock on ability where they slice the enemy, applying a bleed effect on the enemy similar to Darius (Damage on Time abilities similar to burns and poisons).

R: the ultimate is the Assassin locking onto a target and repeatedly stabbing the enemy multiple times (symbically in reference to how the soul felt being betrayed by their group of Assassins). This Ultimate might be broken so an alternative ability would be throwing daggers around them that slow everyone down within their radius (similar to Katarina... or an Assassin Rogue from World of Warcraft). The catch is that they must repeatedly press the ability 5 times, similar to a Jhin ult. Daggers will be sticking in those caught in the fan of daggers so his Q will be off of cooldown fairly fast



Marksman mask, a pirate from Bilgewater who died from Gankplank obliterating their crew. The soul seeks vengeance, ready to confront any enemy Gank Plank on the rift. Their dying moments would've been being Hanged in the death sentence cage, having birds slowly eat the individual to death before having their dead body dumped into the vast ocean. The mask has a skullike pattern and an upside down triangle on the nose, resembling the beak of a Raven, all done in a Dark Blue color.

Q: fires a Lock on shot similar to Miss Fortune with the twist of ghostly shrapnel exploding near the target. The shot also applies a slow to the target temporarily.

W: Sends a ghostly chain, that slowly slithers like a snake. This chain is used in a similar manner to Kalista's Whisps however, those that come near the chain become temporarily stunned, providing vision of the target. This spell would have a really high mana cost compared to other spells like the Raven skillshot and the exploding bullet

E: a Raven is sent forth to fetch the Marksman some life steal, this slows the enemy down in the process. This acts as a skillshot with a friendly Raven providing heals, similar to Swain's passive regarding damage.

R: the ultimate is of the masked Marksman, locking their enemy within the same cage like coffin. Ravens slowly feast upon the enemy, giving the individual omnivamp. If the person moves, dragging the person with them, they take damage from the coffin sliding. Bonus damage is applied if the ultimate is within the river, with the person both slowly drowning while fish as well slowly eat upon the victim. The victim is at a similar vulnerability to that of a skarner dragging a frozen enemy. Ally champions can also join in with dealing damage to the ulted individual however the ultimate duration might become shorter, damaging the cage more, reducing the duration of the ult in the process. If the person survives, the duration of the ultimate, the cage will break, freeing the victims.",1652731959

leagueoflegends,This game is horrendous.,"Hope this post doesn't get taken down due to the overly polarizing nature of ""LEAGUE GOOD! NO SAY OTHERWISE!"" on this forsaken subreddit but here goes:

I recently reinstalled after a 1.5 year hiatus and played a couple of ARURF games and 3 ranked games. Out of the eight or so games I played today, I incidentally ended up having to dodge three lobbies.

First dodge was in ARURF, where queue times literally take 3 seconds to find a match and it was because I had to go eat dinner. Got a 5 minute dodge-penalty, fair enough, no big deal I thought.

Second dodge was in a ranked lobby, wherein I encountered a very toxic lobby and with two players legit threatening to run it down due to there being conflict or whatever. I wasn't interested/didn't want to risk wasting my time, so I dodged. This time I got hit with a 30-minute dodge timer. Odd, I thought, I could've sworn it was 10-15 minutes from memory. Oh well, no big deal I can queue again.

Final dodge and my last straw: Queued for ARURF game, got in lobby within 3 seconds and my laptop crashed due to no memory or something. ""Shoot"". I reboot my laptop and go back into league, expecting to wait a 30-minute timer. Instead, I was rudely greeted by a ridiculous 12 HOUR DODGE PENALTY.

This game literally WANTS people to uninstall.

Well, it didn't last long everyone, sayonara! I am never touching this title for the rest of my life.

To those that didn't play pre Season 5/4, I feel bad. Those were truly the best days and it's honestly sad to see how far this game has fallen. Game is literally a husk of its former self.

leagueoflegends,part 1 of 3 regarding a Champion Ideas (mask bearers: Physical attackers),"This is going to be split into a 3 part post, covering a Champion who bears multiple masks. Similar to a Viktor, they purchase an item, exclusive to the Champ, leveling it up in a similar manner to that of a support or jungle item. This 1st part is gonna cover the Barbarian and Duelist Masks

Passive: many masks to choose from within the item shop which grant abilities of their own.

Maskless moveset:

Auto attacks: a pistol with very limited range catch is, this individual would have moderate mana regeneration, allowing them to still use such abilities

Q: the individual throws a dagger which gives a bit of Burst damage (however not a lot) similar to how champions like Shaco throws daggers albeit without any form of slow

W: the individual shoots a Lock on Bullet similar to Teemo and Miss Fortune; however, there is no catch to such shot, therefore being slightly obsolete

E: stun skill shot ability where the stun duration is extremely short. If you wanted to Troll, you could build execute, skill shot an enemy, dagger someone and then shoot the enemy but the damage to the shot and dagger are useless, being so low, trying to get any kills by yourself would be difficult (it's to convince players to bear a mask rather than troll)

R: nothing... by a mask instead of inting or trolling!!! &gt;:v



Tank/Juggernaut Mask, the soul of a former Barbarian who lost their soul in a dishonorable fight. The soul could easily originate from many regions including Freljord, Noxus, Icathia or Valoran. If they were from Freljord, they would've been a soul who died at the hands of Aatrox, if they were from Noxus, they would've been a Gladiator similar to Xin Xiao, forced to fight and survive, eventually being used as a pawn within the army, either dying in the war with Demacia or Ionia. The icathia part would be a Freljordian Bodyguard who came to the city to protect Zilean, dying at the hands of the void, protecting a recently resurrected Zilean. For Valoran, the the story would be similar to Icathia but with the quest of protecting Veigar, failing at the hands of Mordekaiser with Veigar being banished to his prison, being socially isolated. Many ways they can go with the lore regarding this warrior. The Mask has 3 Claw like rips design wise, bearing a Red color.

Q: the Barbarian swings a battle axe in a similar manner to an Aatrox or a Darius swing, dealing moderate damage.

W: the warrior gains armor in a similar manner or a Warwick or a Jax; however, landing an auto attacks will cancel the effect of the protection. The catch is that the auto attack that cancels such effects will slow his enemy and do additional damage either scaled via health or scaled via Attack Damage. There could be potentially some omnivamp applied to allow for some healing in the process as well.

E: the warrior draws blood, sacrificing health in a similar manner to a Mundo sacrificing health, smearing their blood on their battle axe. This ability grants him a slight buff in attacks for a certain duration. The catch is, there is a timer so if you draw blood and do not attack for a certain amount of time, you will not be able to use the ability and it will reset onto cooldown. This would be like having a Jax, Darius and Mundo mix where he sacrifices some hp for a temporary attack buff In addition to combining other abilities. He would be a lethal close range Juggernaut that would have to be picked off via Marksman or Mage (anything projectile related)

R: The Warrior drinks from a flask, becoming buffed and strong similar to a Nasus, Renekton or Alistar ult. He has increased attack damage and amplified omnivamp if he lands a W on an enemy. This could be seen as slightly overkill, buffing upon buffing attacks, almost making his attack combos potentially one shot OP however, he has limited Crowd Control and there could easily be a reduction in movement speed to prevent the brute from being overkill or the abilities would be placed on high cooldown to make the mask bearer choose their fights wisely.



Duelist's Mask, a former bladesman that would've parried attacks, been swift on their feet with dashes and swift to cut up enemies, dead from a Duel they lost to. This soul could easily either originate from Demacia or Ionia. If they were from Demacia, they could've been friends with Fiora, training with her in combat, eventually dying in the Demacian war by an unworthy fighter like Sion. Regarding Ionia, they could've been blood related to Irelia, dying in the town massacre. The Duelist has a golden or silver color bar that vertically goes along the nose, similar to how a Duelist raises their blade upwards, on the ready.

Q: the masked bladesman dashes towards the enemy with their blade outward, stabbing people that it hits. This ability is followed by the bladesman having the ability either to jump back half the distance of the thrust or not (that would have to be a small time frame like 2-3 seconds).

W: the Duelist, places their blade on guard, any magic projectile fired in front of the blade during the ability's duration is reflected back. This will only be applicable to projectiles from the front of the model, anything behind them is free game, still leaving them slightly vulnerable. This can be seen as equally annoying as a Yasuo windwall; however, the ability would be of a shorter time duration to prevent the ability from being overkill.

E: The Duelist swipes their blade back and forth 3 times. This could be comparable to a Riven or Aatrox mixed with 3 Camille leg slices. If the enemy has all 3 slices land, they become slow (unlike Aatrox or Riven where all hits cause the slow effect)

R: the Duelist teleports an enemy into a palace where they then proceed to attack the enemy in a similar manner to a Camille or Fiora ultimate. The palace would be a reference to the spirit's memory of Fencing for a royal audience's entertainment if they go down the Demacian route. The palace would instead of glowing in the ghostly Teal color, be a bright golden yellow color like a heavenly light",1652731172
leagueoflegends,[Controversial Opinion] Vayne is the best adc design of League,"So here is why:

She is fun to play. Rewarding, but with insane skillcap, with very satisfying moments. Now this is of course subjective, but I think most league players love a great vayne montage.

She is easy to balance. This is arguable until you realise everything she provides can easily be toned up or down with no isses at all. She is one of the most simple champions to balance really.

She has clear strength and weaknesses. She is a true adc: if she survives she can shred most targets with ease. However, she is very low range, so it's not easy to get her to do that and she is really easy to punish. It is also very easy for her to overcommit and overstep and get collapsed on even with her e. She is very weak to cc, just like any other adc. For this she is a good duelist and if you are insane at playing with her she is good at kiting.

She is ""ahead"" of her time. She was released really long ago and she is yet to receive a rework. Her kit is working, and its probably not on the rework list. Her longitivity is impressive.

She is still relevant. Not only in soloq, but in pro play too. Not many old champions make it there (without being reworked), maybe Udyr so it's very impressive.

Overall one of the better adcs in the game, even if she has a bad reputation.",1652731092

leagueoflegends,Hot take: I could see assassins rising in priority after the durability patch.,"With the upcoming durability patch, alot of people have been saying that assassins are going to be garbage after the changes. While I do agree that they will probably be worse, I could also see them being more important after the changes.

I guess I should start by describing what I think makes a good team comp. A good team comp is a combination of 2 major things, a goal and a checklist. A goal for a team comp is a very simple concept; it is how your team wants to play. You might be a poke comp or a front to back teamfight comp or a dive comp. I'm not going to go into much more detail about this since it is the less important part for this discussion. What I want to talk about is the checklist. A good team comp NEEDS to have certain things. One major example of this is damage spread. A good team comp will have a mix of physical and magic damage because otherwise the enemy team just wins by stacking resists. A team comp of Teemo, Nidalee, Zoe, Ziggs, and Lux will have amazing poke but it will be an awful team comp because it has a damage spread so awful that an ADC player would buy resists against it (alongside other problems). Another checkbox might be the ability to siege/take baron. It won't matter how good your comp is at teamfighting if you can never take any objectives or siege.

Going back to assassins, one checkbox that they cross out for a team comp is the ability to pick off a squishy. If the enemy jinx walks abit too far forward, A zed or a talon is going to kill them. Assuming that the assassin is building full damage, I'm pretty sure that this will still be the case after the durability patch. What is changing though is that alot of other champions are losing that ability. Champions like riven and wukong might not have enough burst to do that now. Maybe an Ahri combo won't quite be enough to kill the ADC. This means that, in order to check off that box, you need someone who can currently overkill an ADC. An assassin building full damage will do that. Even if they are worse at it than they are currently, so is everyone else. Burst damage is all about breakpoints and I could see assassins being the one of the only classes to still meet the breakpoints required from a burst damage champion.

Basically, in the current meta, why would you pick an assassin when a mage or bruiser can just do your job and offer more. With the durability changes, burst damage is going to become more of a champion specific niche, meaning that those who are still capable of killing someone 100-0 will rise in priority.

One example of increased damage hurting assassins is [Zed's pro play](https://gol.gg/champion/list/season-S8/split-ALL/tournament-ALL/) presence between seasons 7 and 8. During season 7, Zed had a 6% pro play presence (75 picks, 120 bans, 61% winrate). While this isn't a ton, it is respectable. In season 8, Zed's pro presence was 1% (16 picks, 15 bans, 50% winrate). Between [these 2 seasons](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Zed/LoL/Patch_history), Zed only recieved 1 direct nerf, which was a compensation nerf for a buff he recieved on the same patch. Also, that compensation nerf was reverted soon after while he kept the buff. So, why would zed disappear like that? One major change that season 8 made was the introduction of the new runes system, which was a pretty large damage increase for the game. While I can't be certain that this increase in damage is what caused zed to fall out of favor for pros, I do think it is a pretty reasonable assumption that Zed was lower priority because of the changes.

TL;DR: Assassins may end up being better after the durability changes because less other champions will be able to fill that burst niche. We have seen something similar in the past where Zed's pro play presence dropped when the overall damage in the game was increased, despite the fact that Zed recieved no direct nerfs.",1652730385

leagueoflegends,A potential way to improve quality of life for botlaners.,"Something I was just thinking about while browsing reddit is that basically every marksman player hates having cs stolen by their support when they are brawling with enemy heroes in lane. In turn, supports get tilted when they get a good chunk of damage off as xerath or lux and their duo partner flames them for killing a cannon. I was trying to figure out a fix for this and am wondering if this would work.

Give support items a passive that cuts support damage done to lane minions by an amount, probably 50%. You could maybe even limit the damage mitigation to only apply to damage from abilities and not auto attacks. This would solve two problems. The first is that it would make it much harder for supports to accidentally cs and give them more freedom to cast spells through the minion wave, thus causing less tension in a game that already has a lot of teams fighting with each other. The second upside is that if riot ever puts more power into support items, if you do 50% reduced damage to minions it would probably be pretty hard to use the item in other lanes, thus preventing some of the off-meta support item abuse that has happened in the past. 

Is there something I'm obviously missing here or could this idea be workshopped into a net positive for league?",1652729957

leagueoflegends,[Serious]League of Legends has a really threatening toxicity Problem!,"  

Hey guys, I just wanted to write down my thoughts on the current state of League of Legends SoloQ.  
To give you some background I am a player  since season 7, and I am currently Gold4 9LP. In my last 20 games I had to deal with several AFks, racist people, toxic people ( wishing cancer and more!) and serious trolling ( not just having a bad game). Many of you will have those experiences too! But some will say that this is just in one of maybe 20 games, the case. For me this is very harming, and I am very sad after those games. It often ruins my whole gaming session!  
For me this is a very serious problem and I would say that this whole thematic it at its peak! Yes League of Legends community is very toxic and yes I know I will get several comments and hate but I think that Riot has to do something immediately.    
From what I heard, there was a program before my time in League were other people voted for others if they deserve a ban. I do not know if something similar can help here, but all in all something has to happen! And I mean something big.   
I do not want to play a game where several people behave like racists, sexists or homophobia. Sure I could just mute chat in whole, but that is not the point of the chat, because for me the chat is very useful (e.g. timing sums etc.)   
In addition, I think this act is also in the interest of Riot. You do not want to have players like this in your game and disturb other players.    
I hope you can understand my point of view and maybe can add to it or disagree.  
Have a nice day and see you &lt;3",1652729143

**Introduction**

Hello Reddit. At the moment Riot is doing a great job with their mid-scope updates for different champions. These mini-reworks are a perfect way to bring some of the older champions in league up to date with the rest of the competition. With how successful most of the recent updates were, I thought it could be interesting to talk about other possible champions that could benefit from a similar treatment.

I saw today‚Äôs post about Maokai on the frontpage. In there a lot of people mentioned how he feels a bit underwhelming to play in his current form and that he would probably deserve some bigger scale changes that help him catch up with the rest of the game again. That's why I wanted to take the opportunity and share some of the ideas I have thought about when it comes to potential changes for the tree.

*Quick note: I will present my list of changes first and then explain the reasoning behind them later on. The changes will include actual number adjustments. But the exact numbers are less important and mostly just there to show how power could be pushed around between different parts of the kit. I‚Äôm also fully aware of the big durability update that is coming to league next patch. But I still decided to include the numbers the way they are currently listed on the league wiki, to keep it easier for comparison. That said, all numbers would obviously have to get adjusted accordingly to the upcoming durability changes.*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uftfhl6mwvz81.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ff5851268ce3ef459db262b8dd322465f7194b4

**Summary:** Initial passive proc gives more health. Q mana cost lower early on. E sapling damage reduced. Maokai now gets bonus move speed and W range against opponents hit by saplings. R moves faster initially, but speed and cc-duration grow less over time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Explanation for the Changes:**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Passive base healing increased  \[5-65 &gt;&gt; 8-80 (based on level) health\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Passive percentage healing increased \[5-15% &gt;&gt; 6-18% (based on level) of Maokai's maximum health\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Sap Magic's healing is reduced to 80% effectiveness, if the ability was already casted once in the last 8 seconds.

Passive changes are mostly targeted towards top lane Maokai. Currently he has an incredibly hard time surviving against a lot of matchups up there. Most bruisers and fighters (with runes like Conqueror or Lethal Tempo) easily beat him in extended 1v1s.

Maokai‚Äôs best bet is to look for short trade windows, where he can use a few abilities, proc his passive and then disengage. But even that playstyle has stopped working over the years, since most opponents can easily match or beat his sustain over time.

One big problem I see with Maokai‚Äôs passive is that it basically has to be balanced around two different things. It has to be strong enough to give him a realistic chance of surviving 1v1s in lane (something he is really struggling with at the moment). But it also can't be too strong, because that could result in him becoming too ‚Äúdrain-tanky‚Äù in bigger teamfights (where he is already fine for the most part).

Buffing the passive and then only making the initial passive proc heal for 100% effectiveness would be a great opportunity to give Maokai more value in these short trades in lane, without automatically making him too oppressive in extended teamfights. Since his sustain in longer fights would mostly stay the same.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Q mana cost changed  \[60 mana at all ranks &gt;&gt; 48 / 52 / 56 / 60 / 64 mana\]  
&gt;  
&gt;W mana cost increased  \[60 &gt;&gt; 70 mana at all ranks\]

The Q mana cost changes are trying to fix another important issue for top lane Maokai. Unlike most of the popular top laners these days, he is still heavily restricted by mana early on. Maokai has a lot of bad matchups in lane, which means he already has a fairly hard time contesting for the minion wave. His Q is his main spell to trade, farm, push and stack up his passive. But the current mana cost of his lower-ranked Q is simply too high for this. Reducing the mana cost early on would give Maokai a bit more freedom to utilize his main tool in lane more often. To balance things out the mana cost would be slightly higher from level 9 onwards (Top Lane Maokai maxes Q first). And a part of the mana cost is also pushed into his W, so his full combo against champions would still cost about the same amount of mana as it does now.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;E base damage and percentage damage (for both regular and brush empowered saplings) decreased  
&gt;  
&gt;Enemy champions hit by saplings are now additionally marked for 4 seconds.  
&gt;  
&gt;Maokai gains 10% bonus movement speed when moving towards marked enemy champions.  
&gt;  
&gt;W target range (radius that Maokai can cast W in) is increased against enemy champions that were previously marked by (E) Sapling Toss.  \[525 base range &gt;&gt; 700 range\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally deals 4% of target's maximum health against enemy champions that were previously marked by (E) Sapling Toss.

The E+W changes only make sense when looking at them combined. They are trying to target two important areas at once. First they would shift some power out of Maokai‚Äôs saplings. Which would be a decent way of making his E-max sapling-into-bush-spam playstyle a bit less annoying to face for a lot of opponents.

On the other hand the changes would also help Maokai himself with one of his main weaknesses. With his current kit he is rather bad in the one thing that tanks are supposed to be really good at: engaging. His slow Ultimate is too unreliable of a tool to start fights with, which makes him very dependent on his W.

Now, his W is definitely a super strong ability. It's a point-and-click cc that also makes Maokai untargetable for a short frame. But it also pays a reasonably high price for this by having rather low range in return. This often makes Maokai very dependent on having Flash up to find engage opportunities. Without it he has a fairly hard time reaching opponents before he gets cc-ed or kited.

The idea of the new E+W combo is to give Maokai the same treatment that Xin Zhao got with his rework in the past. He would basically have a long-ranged ability that opponents have a fair chance of dodging or avoiding. But if the ability hits, Maokai gets additional range on his shorter-ranged point-and-click engage spell. This would give Maokai a more reliable engage tool, while still leaving his opponents enough room for counterplay.

I believe this combination of changes would push Maokai into a much healthier direction, especially when considering his current poke playstyle in the support position. He would probably still be a viable support that is great at controlling certain areas of the map with his saplings. But it would be less because of his uninteractive long-ranged poke and more because of the increased engage threat he offers when opponents walk near his controlled area.

The E+W changes would also fix another smaller issue. At the moment it feels extremely one-dimensional how Maokai can use his E. Throwing it anywhere outside of bushes might be borderline-trolling, since the damage is terrible and it's super easy to avoid.

The changes would open up a lot more possibilities of how Maokai could utilize his E outside of bushes. For example to set up ganks for his jungler. Maokai could throw a sapling behind his lane opponent and basically force that opponent into taking a suboptimal escape route. Otherwise they would have to tank the sapling and give Maokai a better chance of catching up.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Q damage against monsters increased to 120%

The Q damage buff against monsters is mainly to compensate for the sapling nerfs. Maokai's AoE damage to camps would suffer a bit from those adjustments and the small Q buff is supposed to make up for that. On top of that Jungle Maokai would also benefit from the passive changes, and the new E+W combo could make his ganks a bit more dangerous. To be honest, I don't believe the update would be enough to make Maokai a fully viable jungler again, but it might be just enough to at least give him the chance of becoming a rare niche pick.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;R root duration decreased  \[0.8-2.6 &gt;&gt; 0.8-2.0 (based on distance traveled) seconds\]  
&gt;  
&gt;R travel speed changed  \[50-600 &gt;&gt; 80-500 units per second, accelerating over traveled time\]

These changes are basically supposed to make Maokai‚Äôs R slightly weaker but more reliable. At the moment a lot of the abilities' power-budget is wasted on the long root-duration and high speed it gets after having traveled for a long distance.

But hitting such a long-ranged R is pretty unrealistic in most cases. It can definitely be useful in situations where Maokai is flanking, but that is unlikely to happen considering that Maokai is often going to be the main frontliner on his team. Ideally he wants to be positioned between his own team and the enemy one when fights are breaking out. Adjusting Maokai‚Äôs R to move slightly faster initially would give him a bit more engage threat in these conventional front-to-back teamfight scenarios.

Maokai‚Äôs R is already a great zoning tool for objectives. But it still feels a bit lackluster, when most opponents can just outrun it pretty easily. What this leads to in most situations is that Maokai will only use his R when he‚Äôs already on top of opponents for the instant root. It's basically only used as a cc-extension after his W. Which is quite sad and can‚Äôt really be the way his Ultimate is intended to be used.

I don't believe Maokai would need a completely different Ultimate to function properly. His old damage-reduction Ult (especially the second iteration that followed him around) was definitely stronger, but it also made him extremely stat-checky and unfun to play against. His current Ultimate seems a lot more creative and thematically fitting. I honestly believe the slow travel speed is all that would have to be changed in order to make it feel more rewarding again. Opponents would probably still have a fairly easy time getting away from it in most cases. But the change would still give Maokai a few more options on how he wants to use his Ult in different situations.

\-

Now, I can definitely understand people that would like to see bigger changes to Maokai, like completely reworking parts of his current ability set. The problem is that these bigger changes would obviously require a lot of work on Riot‚Äôs end that I‚Äôm not sure they are willing to invest in the near future. My approach here would probably still be enough to fix most of Maokai‚Äôs current issues without even requiring a lot of resources to do so. Most of the changes would be simple stat adjustments. And the only slightly difficult parts would be adding a new visual mark for his E and the conditionally increased range on his W. But even those additions should be fairly easy to implement.

Well, that's about it. Would love to hear your opinion on the ideas.",1652728804

leagueoflegends,How I got Gold for the first time.,"**How I got Gold for the First Time**

**Tip and tricks and things I learned**

Firstly I would like to start by saying I am by no means the best, unless we are talking about people who have most recently achieved gold 4 in the middle of May only playing Tahm Kench, then I am in the running for something. What I do claim to be the best at is playing the game my way, the fact that got me to gold might come as a surprise to many of you but I am proud of it. These are some of the fundamental concepts and things I learned to help me achieve this momentous feat.

**Lane Assignment and Champion Choice(s)**

I do my absolute best to only play Tahm Kench, he is the only champion and all other ones do not come close to as enjoyable as he is. I will be playing him until Tahm Kench 2: Back in Action comes out, for now he is the one true River God. I mainly would play top with a secondary role in jungle. I choose jungle as a secondary role because I know I won't get it, so that leaves me securing top lane. Now why Tahm Kench you ask yourself, well you would be right that is a question. I play him because he big and he lick, I‚Äôve played top lane before his rework and I continued to make it work. Some may say he is better than he ever was before, but I think this is his second coming. 

**Ban(s)**

I ban Garen, fuck Garen, I hate Garen. I think he is lazing, boring, (strong), bad, stupid, (slightly overtuned), annoying, gross, (a good champion), and dumb. I dont even think he has a good matchup into Tahm Kench, I actually am just annoyed by everything he does. I believe the fact I have never played against a Garen as a top laner this whole season has played a significant role in my success in climbing.

**Team Compositions**

This has 2 parts, one being your team structure and the teammates you have. Firstly, just always get the better team. It helps that my father works for Riot and I can call him before I queue to ask for the good team. The good team will usually consist of people who are better than the other team. If you can have that you will be in the clear. I remember an old adage that there was some percentage of your games you are meant to lose, just don't do that, it's very simple and helped me. Secondly always create a team comp that lend to your strengths, you already know your mid is going to be Yasuo, and your jungle will be Yi and your adc will be Ezreal, so just play tank and never die its very simple. Even when they hit their 0/10 power spikes, you will be safe knowing that your 300 armor won't let the enemy Graves kill you that fast.

**Laning and Map Awarness**

Laning is my personal favorite part about the game because I enjoy farming and fighting people on a deserted island that only has visitors from the other team. Tahm's fighting style has always been comfortable for me and helps me have confidence in lane. I don't claim to have all the knowledge of the game at all times, but I do know every time I push up, the enemy jungle will be top, and when i'm pushed in, no one knows top lanes exists. If you can live with those truths you will have much more peace of mind and will be able to concentrate on missing cannon. Also vision is good, I know because I am horrible at it. I can confidently say on my way to Gold 4 I purchased no more than 2 control wards. This is a bad habit of mine, but vision doesn't do damage and I choose to be suborn. If my pink word worked like my towers in bloons tower defense maybe I would consider it, but dammit this ruby crystal is like 2% more damage on my autos. 

**Ending the Game**

There has always been only two options when I am playing in the mid to late game, split push or group and die with my teammates. I was cognizant enough to know when each game plan would benefit my team the most, and knowing when each would help us win was important. Much of this came unconsciously and I allowed my first and only instinct to drive my decision. If I would constantly see my team die, I would not join, if I constantly saw them kill the other team, I would not join, if I saw a healthy dose of both, I would not join. What I am trying to say is I love split pushing and I think everyone should try it. 

**Communication**

I will be the first to admit I am not the most sane league player at times, most of the time I have my chat disabled. That is for my own mental health and the wellbeing of my very fragile teammates. I do now wish to call people poopy dumb dumbs but dangit if you keep dying to Katerina one more time Im going to tell you mom says its time to get off the computer. But communication is key, whether you are communicating through pings, voice comms, or blatantly toxic remarks, it is a part of the game and sometimes necessary. And most of the time I need to turn my chat back on to message the enemy top laner ‚Äú?‚Äù when I kill them. So in short communicate and keep a level head but also stop letting Katerina get 7 kills when I haven't even backed yet Kevin.

**Closing Message**

That's really the key, the best part of the game is that it's, not fun, it's horrible, time consuming and draining. But when you get past that, it's shit, it's abysmal and you shouldn't play it. After you come to terms with that, the game is trash, it shouldn't exist and deserves no recognition. When you get down to it, this game is terrible and kills my willingness to feel anything on a daily. If after all of that there is any sliver of a redeeming quality to take form this, it should be this: Have Fun.

But one thing that I have noticed is the sheer amount of bot accounts (On the player teams) that are mainly being used for account selling, etc. I try to work around them, but not one of them ever stays in their lane, they leech kills, etc.

Now personally, I know Riot has other (Bigger) issues to deal with. But it is a big gap in oversight, really. I wouldn't be surprised if half those accounts got to 30, unlocked some champ, and immediately got posted on a smurf account selling site.

leagueoflegends,The state of ff is terrible,"Pick a late game champ die once early ff, jungler missed first drag ff, my mid/jg/bot etc died ff, even in aram people try to ff. Everyone wants to ff and for what? Most of the time it's because they are not carrying the game, they need to be the carry the hero or the game is lost without them even with othee winning lanes. What I'm getting at is why are people so keen on giving up just because they lose one engage, why is it so hard to just not fight when behind or not afk because you lost 1v1. There are games you can and should ff but just play out your game. Another big problem these players tend to do is farm theirs own junglers farm if they choose to not run it or afk which then sets behind another person because of how petty they are. Just accept a carry, not every game you are going to win it for the team accept it let someone else do it.

For the last years the only rotating game modes that we had were URF and OFA, with the ""ultimate on a summoner"" thing with the viego release and one time a nexus blitz.

IT SUCKS.

URF is litteraly the worst game mode ever released by Riot at this point. It was fun when it was released but now that everyone is playing like it's fucking Soloq the games are unbearable. Every time half of the players take exhaust because this summoner is so OP in this mode, every time people play the laning phase like it's fucking MSi finale, every time people go for the most tryhard obnoxious build (can you just try to have fun and build irelia AP instead of BORK DD Shieldbow ?)...

We need a brain off mode, take the old dominion map, make people spawn lvl 3 and just let them murder each other. Each kill gives XP and multiple kill streaks give you a buff but no golds, make a high passive generation and just let people fight without a team taking a lead so strong on the other that they just suffer.

Or just bring back the old game modes, the thresh hooking minigame, the blood moon deathmatch mode, PVE modes, bots of doom, dominion, ascencion... But please give me someting else that urf every other patch.

All 3 games were a loss. Countless times of having to carry is so frustrating, if the enemy focuses me in these games? We just lose. I was forced to play safe by the cards LOL dealt me, and that wasn't even enough to win. I even pinged, tried to get teammates to group up, and nothing worked. 



Some think there's a 60/20/20 percent rule, 60% you win, 20% no matter what you lose, and 20% you have en effect. It REALLY feels like  20/60/20 rule. I can carry as hard as I may try, even with another randoms like the lee sin of one game, but we just can't. I really wish this game wasn't so snowbally that one teammate couldn't cause the enemies to get out of control. Gold is gold, even with diminishing returns if a player gets fed from a teammate inting, it's harder to kill them regardless, yea the bounty is nice but you gave to overcome the fed enemy AND teammates. 



I also understand players have bad days/games, but I really find it hard to believe 60% of my times a majority of the time, are all having bad games JUST that match. It's so common for me to have 2-3 inters. Yea I have some bad games too, but I still try to teamfight even when behind unlike the teammates I get. 


In the end I'm asking how can I even better deal with this? I'm starting to reach a limit on how nice I can be with how consistent I have teammates that won't do anything for anyone. 



TlDR: How do I overcome being toxic when you just hit a barrier of teammates not working together for a common objective of winning.",1652719200

leagueoflegends,Move power out of 1 item spike on supports,"1 completed item + upgraded support item give way too many stats for that time in the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Supports can get to their 1 item spike fairly easily with support item income + kill participation gold. However, it becomes very difficult for them to earn gold afterwards (unless you are playing mage ""support"" and farming kills) and hit 2 or 3 items. 

  
I propose that support items get nerfed stats, but generate gold for longer to smooth out the power scaling of supports a little bit, since they currently become Jesus himself at 1 item then proceed to fall off a cliff.

leagueoflegends,"Open Discussion: How to fix Smurf queue (spoiler, it's not easy)","Greeting League Reddit.  
I would personally like to have a small discussion about the current system refered to as ""smurf queue"", mostly because a ""smurf-queue bad pls fix"" post won't get us anywhere.   


**For those who don't know:**

Some time ago, when player complains about smurfs ruining their ranked experience reached an all time high. Riot implemented a band aid solution which puts players with a low amount of ranked games in recent time into games where everyone has a low number of ranked games played. This was called ""smurf queue"" as most of these games contain accounts of lv 35 and under. This system kind of successfully isolated the active ranked playerbase from the smurfs. This however created another problem. Those games will also include new players and players who have barely played ranked but are now trying to return to the grind. And smurf queue games, let me tell you, are extremely toxic. Skill desparity aside, some people don't smurf because they want to learn a new role, they do so because their last account got banned and sure as hell they will still throw a tantrum whenever one thing goes wrong. Flame, Soft inting, Ragequits. Every horror story you have heard about a league game is 10 times more likely to happen here than anywhere else. One of the biggest issues is that currently, you can easily buy a lv 30 account for basically pocket change, so toxic players do not care if their new account gets punished. 1 transaction later they are back on the rift  


Needless to say. Smurf queue should always be seen as a band-aid solution so today I would like to discuss some possible solutions as everything I came up with either does not work or is strictly wishful thinking  


**some things to keep in mind when coming up with solutions:**  
\- smurfs themselves are pretty much inevitable  
\- the solution should benefit returning players and first time ranked players as they are put into this toxic mess  
\- we should not sacrifice a part of the community for our solution (as the current system does)  


**1: Make it so high lv players are not matched with lv 30 accounts**  
\-&gt; this is just ok but where do you put the line? It might lead to botters leveling their accounts to just above that threshhold. It also kind of messes with newer players. League takes a lot of time to learn so even I wouldn't recommend ranked at lv 30 but the idea of waiting even longer than reaching 30 just so you can play a more fun ranked mode in a video game seems ridiculous  


**2. Make it so a high lv player that has played ranked in past seasons is not put into smurf queue**  
\-&gt; yes, that works, but it only works for returning players. Everyone who tries ranked for the first time is still kind of screwed. I also believe we had an article or post talking about returning players into smurf queue problem and how they want to attack that but i don't think we have heard about that ever since  


**3. The main problem are websites selling cheap smurfs, just ban botted accounts**  
\-&gt; the problem with botting is mainly that botters will figure out how to avoid bot detection and whenever bot detection is improved and those accounts get banned, they will just figure out how to avoid the newer system. I have very little tech-knowledge, so don't take what i say for granted. It's quite easy to spot a botted account as a human, but detection through a system is quite problematic.  


**4. Just fix the report system and hire more Humans for manual review**  
\-&gt; Part of the problem is that there are a lot of games and players to review, so like it or not, we have to rely on the report system to filter cases for humans to review. Unfortunately, the threshhold of how many reports are needed to ensue punishment is quite high. Why is that? because the report system is used by everyone. What i mean by that is you can click that report button for whatever reason you want and there are a ton of reports for things that are not banworthy. Raise your hand if a player in your last 3 games wanted to report the most underperforming (not inting!) player on his team. For the hiring part: I think we are lacking information on how exactly all of this works to estimate if that even helps  


**5. Just make a ""smurf queue police"" Games could be flagged as smurf queue games and reports are quicker to lead to manual review**  
\-&gt;similar to people asking for a high elo police due to wintrading, this will likely not happen. Also, a lot of the extremely toxic cases wont even care if they are banned after 8 games or after 4, just ""go next"". Again, i have no clue how the manual reviews even work and if hiring people even does something  
**5.5 How about doing it without humans and let the ban system trigger quicker?**  
\-&gt; that doesn't really change a lot. Toxic people will have a lighter wallet yes, some might even get discouraged. the main problem with no humand review in this case is: remember what i said about reporting, how a tilted player will report an underperforming teammate, perhaps a player who just played his first few ranked games and got heavily outclassed because of course? yea that does not work. If you want to tighten to report system, it needs more humans IMO  

**6. Just give them the Tyler 1 treatment. Ban all accounts belonging to repeat offenders**
\-&gt; Again, not a tech expert, but i don't think IP bans are possible with how data protection and VPN networks function nowadays. I am very open to be educated if I am wrong.

**TLDR/Conclusion:**  
It's just hard to implement changes, you might be able to filter out the returning player, but 1st time ranked players aren't really distinguishable from smurfs and until the system releases them from smurf queue hell, they will likely have quit already. Turning off chat helps but Soft inting is still and issue and will be until the end of time  
If you really like instant feedback reports, you will get some playing smurf queue. trust me, I made this post out of spite",1652717814

leagueoflegends,Looking for teammates.,"Greetings,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a level 158, unranked player on League of Legends and would like to know if anyone would be willing to play with me sometimes. To be frank, I'm not very good at the game itself and don't know much about it. I'm currently trying my best to become a better player and thus, by learning everything I can: new champions, their abilities, items and builds, different roles and mechanics, etc...

It gets hard at times, especially since I don't really have anyone to coach me or give me advices. Of course, I look up things on Internet but I think it's always better to have someone to play with, who can explain things to me while in a game. I'm not interested in ranked games, I just like playing drafts and sometimes, other game modes. I've tried solo queue but I'd like to have, at least, a duo with whom I could share some fun with.

My goal is to become decent enough to play any roles and be able to have fun with the champions that interest me. I'm not particularly  looking for strong and skilled players, just people who can teach me some stuff about the game and who don't mind having a bad teammate (I swear, I'm always trying my best, lol).

This sounds very similar to the fall of Icathia in my opinion. When they chose to raise a new King of Magic and cultivate the power of the Void to unleash it against the Shuriman Ascended, only to end with the destruction of the city and all it's survivors, except Jax.

leagueoflegends,URF and ARURF are not fun anymore and I don't understand why the better featured game modes are never seen,"I really had fun playing URF back when I first got to play it and I played it a lot until I saw the same broken champions picked by the enemy. There's no variety whatsoever and it makes the games bland and boring. It takes one game to see how boring this gets to be. You always see Jinx, Zed, Morgana and others. ARURF is not any different. Although you don't see these champions as often, you still see them many times, as you can just reroll until you have a broken champ. **I'm not complaining that URF and ARURF are broken**, that's the point of these game modes after all, but it's really bland and not fun. Also people tend to be more toxic (somehow???) in these game modes, but that might just be for me. 

I played Nexus Blitz back when I first started playing LoL and I had a blast playing it. It was goofy, but still balanced in a way. All the minigames and events were fun and unique. The map was just awesome. It was fun going into a car and crashing into their base. I haven't played Twisted Treeline, but one of my friends that played it said it was the best game mode that they had ever played. I feel like these game modes were way more fun than URF and ARURF are and I don't think I'm the only one to say it. I see it all over the internet, especially for Twisted Treeline.

It sucks that we don't see these much more enjoyable minigames instead of only URF, ARURF and One for All. I get bored of SR and ARAM once in a while and when I go on URF/ARURF to play and their team gets a jinx and goes 30/0/10 or a zed that oneshots you from fountain and I just get stomped only for the enemy to spam ""EZ"" in /all is not really fun for me. EVEN IF I get a broken champ and I destroy the enemy team, I don't feel any better, like I haven't done anything to achieve it, because getting that champ in the champ select doesn't take a lot of effort. 

And why aren't we seeing Nexus Blitz, Twisted Treeline, Dominion, etc. ? Because URF, ARURF and One for All are more popular? That's BS in my opinion. It feels scummy and greedy. Nexus Blitz had more effort put in than there was in URF and ARURF and it showed. I'm really disappointed because of this matter.",1652712326

leagueoflegends,I haven't been this excited to play League since I first started playing,"With 12.10 around the corner, I had this insane realisation.

**I'm genuinely looking forward to playing League again**.

I know there's a lot of us here who have kind of forgotten that *magic* of doing your daily routine and thinking about when you were going to play League at night. I remember it distinctly back in 2015, and over the years it eventually morphed into what is best described as a passive addiction. Passive for me in that I play a lot less than when I first started, but still consume League content every day (youtube, streamers, Reddit, etc). 

But now? Thinking about these huge changes for 12.10? I'm genuinely excited. I have that spark again, and of course I might just be setting the bar too high, but Elden Ring didn't disappoint me, so it proved that sometimes expectatins can be met, and even exceeded.

Of course, not everyone is happy with the changes. I have a particular bias, being an ADC player, as it will make my life much more colorful and less **gray**. I understand that, totally. But these changes were absolutely necessary. Hopefully we'll see a slow shift away from 'if it breathes it will die in 0.2 seconds' to 'if it breathes, we can kill it'. 

I hope there are other people here who are feeling that same feeling revitalized!",1652711886

I do not agree with increasing the number of teams but I think that the champions of the LCK, LPL// LCS, LEC// PCS and VCS // should not participate on play in.  They should be automatically qualified for main stage on two separate groups composed of 4 teams (the two remaining teams comes from the play in)

I'm thinking of this: A play in composed of two groups of three teams (Oceania, LATAM, Brazil, Turkey, Russia and Japan).  They play 4 games in total.  The first of each group qualifies to the main stage.  The top two advance to the semis.  The first of A against the second of B and the first of B against the second of A. And hence the final.  All to the best of 5. Imagine, an example today would be something like this: RNG, EG, Buffalo, aze (xD).  T1, G2, PSG, Canids.

What do you think?

This saves us hours of boring games, and also, to the minor regions fans like me, provides a hard but fair chance to get to the main stage to play against the big boys. 

Also, I think MSI champion should be AQ to Worlds",1652709784

leagueoflegends,Why Is Maokai Top Kept So Weak?,"Maokai used to be my favorite champ. I still love his voicelines, lore and design. The thing is that I used to love his gameplay as well, but ever since he got moved to being a support rather than a tank top I haven't had fun with him a single time.

Why have they done this, and why aren't they changing him to be a viable top anymore? Wasn't he just fine before when he was an actual toplaner? I understand that some people like to play him as a mage/poke support and that's fine, but Maokai top is not only unpopular or niche, it's downright gutted. I have never seen a champion be this bad in what used to be his main role for this long before. When tanks are OP Maokai is super strong, but seeing as tanks aren't overtuned anymore why can't they allow people to play Maokai top?

This is just based on personal experience and his non-existant playrate in toplane but every time I play as, with or against a Maokai top the Maokai can't farm, trade or setup ganks early game without dying but doesn't outscale any champion I can think of. I am genuinely sad by this because I am M7 Maokai and used to love playing him top but now if I wanna play tank there's literally no reason to play Maokai if you don't wanna lose lane and maybe get carried.",1652709374

Now when I ping too fast, the mouse jumps to the right and makes me miss the ping, I tested reverting the UI change but the bug persists...

[Example](https://streamable.com/jy6fnc)

It's so fucking annoying, every single game I try to ping missing I end up pinging OMW or danger. I really need your help to ensure this is not me going insane and test it yourselves...

Steps:

1. Change the UI scale
2. Press the ping button
3. Move mouse to the right
4. Press the left mouse button
5. Move mouse to the left (as little as possible but enough to get the Missing Ping)
6. Release the mouse button
7. Repeat the steps 1-6 as fast as possible, with consistent mouse movement until the cursor jumps to the right and makes you miss-ping

I am confident the cursor blinking to the right side is not a hardware issue because I've tried with a different mouse. It is also not a hand coordination issue because my movements (as seen in the video) are consistent, or at least consistent enough not to missping by a fucking half screen.

I have reported this to riot but neither of the bugs I reported before were fixed, so I have little hopes of it being fixed. I just want to know I'm not alone on this...",1652707683

leagueoflegends,An answer for Jatt and Markz with a better format for MSI,"Markz and Jatt gave a challenge to create a better format without changing the broadcasting block (06 games per day) and the amount of days. Here is a common lower bracket that would work.  

T.L.D.R.: Make the groups stage 02 groups of 06 teams single round robin and change the rumble stage for a double-elimination bracket.  

1st STAGE  (Bo1 Groups)

Now we have a 1st stage of 03 groups of 04 teams double round robin ( 06 days ) a 2nd stage of 06 team double round robin (05 days ) ; and a Finals stage of 2 semis and a final (03 days).  

My suggestion is first change the groups stage to be 02 groups of 06 teams playing a single round robin the top 2 teams go to the upper bracket, the 3rd-4th go to the lower bracket and the bottom 2 would be eliminated. This would be 05 days of broadcast with the 1st to 3rd days being one game per team and the 4th and 5th days being group specific with 2 games per team plus tie-breakers. Here is an example how probably we would have the groups this year.  

Group A | Group B 
:--:|:--: 
RNG | T1 
EG | G2 
PSG | SGB 
AZE | IWC 
DFM | RED 
 | ORDER  

The great thing about this format is slow starter teams like 2019 SKT or 2017 G2 (Vacation anyone?) would probably drop them to need a lower bracket run or at least create a mismatch upper bracket semi-match (LPL vs LCK/EU) where then a top team would drop to the lower bracket.  

2nd and Finals Stage  (Bo3 Lower Bracket and Bo5 Upper Bracket)

After the groups stage we would start directly on the bracket with the lower bracket games always crossing the teams so 3rd from group A vs 4th of Group B. The lower bracket games being Bo3 we have 02 series per broadcast day and would need only 03 days to eliminate 2 teams per day. This year we probably would have this series being played:  

LB Series 01 | LB Series 02 
:--:|:--: 
PSG vs RED | SGB vs DFM 

Guess what? we would probably start the lower bracket with a Bo3 of probably the best games that we had this groups stage.  

For this bracket we would need 02 days for upper semis; 01 day for lower quarters ; 01 day for upper finals; 01 day for lower semis; 01 day for upper finals; 01 day for lower finals (Could be Bo5) ; and finally 01 day for Grand finals. Totaling 08 days vs the 09 days (05 rumble, 03 finals) of the format now. If riot would prefer to have Bo5 lower we would add only 02 more days to the schedule and would have the same size as today but in that case we would probably have 04 days without a top team vs only 02 days in this format.  

I hope this help to show how simple it is to convert MSI to a better format. This is a very commom format in e-sports in a lot of other sports. This format would have a more stable viewership and more meaningful games for better sponshorship deals, better region ranking and more BoSeries between the regions instead of only single matches creating more narratives and rivalries. The possible complains would be maybe less games of the top regions (If they speedrun the upper bracket) and like I said before the group stage is more impactful and punishing so a team with a slow start or in a bad meta read might drop a lot within just a few days but that is the reality of a more impactful format.

Tks for the read! Hope u have a great week and wish riot would see how they can make an even better e-sport that they have now! :)",1652703579

leagueoflegends,"Champion Concept - Orion, the celestial Hunter (ADC)","Hey guys,

as an ADC main who is kind of frustrated with the role in its modern state (which hopefully will benefit from the durability updates), I tried to make a strong ADC that has some survivability and especially skill expression, but not in the form of super creative abilities, but in the art of Auto-Attacking. As an ADC main AAs are the most satisfying and fun, yet most frustrating thing in the game. Nowadays it feels like to expensive of an investment to take all Autos you can hit in a teamfight since it makes you so vulnerable, so I tried to somewhat combat that with tankiness, but more so with a high-risk high-reward passive. Let me know what you guys think, if this is stupid batshit broken or actually decent.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Orion

Range: 550

Passive - Eternal Harvest

Orion's AS through Items is capped at 1.75. He can break this limit with runes, W, and other enchanting items/abilities of his teammates. Every one of Orion's Attacks and Abilities on Champions give him a stack that lasts for 3 seconds. A consecutive stack will refresh the timer until you stopped attacking for 3 seconds. Gaining stacks from separate Enemies with consecutive Attacks/Abilities grants two Stacks instead of one, up to 5 stacks per hit if you rotate through the entire enemy team. A stack gives you (0.5/0.75/1)% MS, (2.5/5/7.5)%AS and (4/7/10) Adaptive Power. If Orion had more than 15 stacks and loses them, all enemies that were stacked upon receive (1/2/3)% max health physical damage per stack that was harvested from them. Alternatively he can choose to consume these stacks before they run out, at any point over 15 stacks. This effect does not trigger when Orion dies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q - Luminous Grasp

Fire a projectile that does (55/85/110/140/175 + 80% AD + 60% AP) on impact. Recast this ability to split the projectile into two parts that diverge horizontally. If two enemies are hit, the Damage is increased by 25% and the enemies get rooted for (0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5 Seconds).

&amp;#x200B;

W - Ascension

For 5/5/6/6/7 Seconds, Orion gains (15%/25%/30%/40%/45% + 5% per 100 Bonus AD) Attack Speed. While Ascension is active, Orion‚Äôs Attacks deal (5/6/7/8/9)% current health bonus damage and give one extra stack of Eternal Harvest. 

&amp;#x200B;

E - Kinetic Beam (750 Range)

Orion fires a beam that deals (70/100/120/140/160 + 110% Bonus AD) physical damage after a 1s charge-up. Orion can recast this ability to surf on the beam as it travels. While surfing he cannot cast spells or attacks. If Orion is attacked in any way during this, his travel is interrupted.

&amp;#x200B;

R - Reverse Exodus

&amp;#x200B;

After a 1s (non-interruptible) cast time, Orion becomes invulnerable to CC for and gains 55/75/95 Armor and MR for 4/4.5/5 seconds. After the effect wears off, he deals 25/35/45% of the damage (before mitigation) dealt to him as AOE on his next Auto-Attack as magic damage. He also heals himself for (10/30/50 + 70% bonus AD) for every stack of Eternal Harvest that he obtained while in Exodus once this ability ends.",1652694031

leagueoflegends,Can maokai already go back to having his old ult?,"riot has made a lot of mid-scope update and reworks to champs that were outright bad and needed to be reverted to their old versions, kog/ zac/ zed/ lb/ rengar for example.  
  
I'd say it's time about time riot reverted maokai as well.  
old maokai's laning phase was meh but the ult made it worth it, now your laning is meh and your ult is meh...but your e does %max hp dmg if you put it in a brush...  why?  
  
ever since this change he's been a gimmicky type of champ and when he could jg with his e, they changed the e damage and stacking power so you can't jg with him anymore.

leagueoflegends,LoL Champion Idea: Blind Billygoat Billy,"The character would be in short, a Blind Anthropomorphic Billygoat who bears a magical military fork. He uses such staff like military fork (2 pronged military fork) and his horns for combat in addition to navigation purposes, similar to a tuning fork. Lore wise, he would likely be an appropriate fit for a place like Freljord due to him being a Goat with hoofs built for such terrain. Billy as a Champion with his kit heavily relies on vision, some crowd control, and a bit of healing, making him a great tanky support or jungler. The support relying heavily on AP, healing his ally ADC and granting the ADC vision while his jungle role could be regarded similar to that of a Jax or a Yi, building AD in addition to using attack speed to activate a certain passive I have mentioned tied to his Q ability (he would have similar versatility to Warwick, Akali, Teemo and Shaco regarding AP and AD, choosing whichever fits the role he's playing).

Abilities:

Main Passive: due to Billy relying heavily on his ears, enemies within areas of no visibility that move near him are picked up similar to a slightly larger oracle lense. The catch is that this vision is only applicable to Billy himself so his allies won't see if there is someone near Billy's Radius. This passive will also only work with Billy if the enemy Champion is moving. An example of the ability at play would be a cloaked teemo standing still in a bush vs. A cloaked teemo running around in a bush. The Teemo standing still will not be detected by the passive however, the teemo running around in the bush will be detected. Similar can be said for traps that stand still so Teemo's Mushroom Mines, Caitlyn's and Nidalee's Bear Traps in a Bush, Jhin's Blossoming Lotus Traps and Shaco's Jack in the Boxes won't be picked up. The only trap that will be picked up would be Maokai's explosive seedling minions due to them moving towards their target.

Q: Billy does a jump dash similar to Kindred to his opponents. If the opponent is in the way of his jump dash, he lands a stun, similar to a Pantheon stun (the catch is that Billy's stun is like a skillshot rather than a Pantheon or Jax pouncing onto their enemies). This ability can be used to hop walls as well, similar to how Kindred is able to so such with her jump dash. 
(Optional) Q Passive: Billy bleeds the opponent after landing 5 consistent hits on the opponent. For each hit, a line is displayed on the enemy Champion's feet, each hit eventually forming a pentacle which then commences the bleeding effect. The bleeding effect would be true damage, similar to Darius's ability; however, unlike Darius where he stacks the bleeding effect, Billy will only have it active it once, making the bleeding effect act similar to a burn or a poison that uses true damage (this ability could potentially be paired with a Jungler running Press the Attack Runes for more effective damage). I labeled this passive as being optional because some could argue that this passive might be overkill within Billy's moveset (one heavily reliant on vision and crowd control). I added this passive for 2 reasons, 1st reason being to secure ganks after landing a stun (if he built jungle) and the 2nd reason was for physical one to one solo combat against champions like Mordekaiser, Sion, Warwick, Thresh, Nautilus, Blitzcrank or Galio

W: Billy Taps his staff on the ground, giving an auditory queue in the form of a whistle, giving allies temporary true vision of his surrounding radius. This Radius would be similar to that of Quinn's heightened senses (if not a slightly larger Radius).

E: Billy starts to hum a musical tune which resonates with his military fork. Billy channels a healing spell, standing in his place, similar to a Master Yi, yet healing allies that surround him as well similar to a Sona or Seraphine's healing ability. This healing ability leaves Billy vulnerable which can easily be used against him by projectile lock champions like Neeko, Lux, Senna, Nami, Brand, Xerath, Morgana, Zyra, etc. Even hook Champion's like Pyke, Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus and regarding enemies in other lanes with similar abilities, Amumu and Sylas. This is a key point because his moveset with abilities like granting vision to allies can be easily regarded as fairly overpowered so having flaws to counter him might be appropriate.

R: Similar to Sion's ult and a Nunu Snowball, Billy Charges towards his enemy, the catch is that the enemy is knocked back in a similar manner to Alistar's charge, doing varied damage similar to a nunu snowball (but the ult isn't heavily reliant on damage, rather the stun brought from it). If the person hits a wall, they will be stunned with varied time similar to that of a Nunu snowball. Billy will also have temporary vision of his opponent when the charge has been successfully landed so even if Billy knocks the opponent back a fair distance after landing his ult, he will still have temporary vision of their whereabouts for a few seconds before they vanish. Optionally, while Billy is charging, this could also act like many staff taps going off at once, giving his allies vision of his surrounding area while charging (similar to Senna's cannon when she ults, giving a trail of vision after its been activated).

This might seem fairly overpowered as a move kit though due to his movement being a mix of Melee (like his jump dash and his ultimate) and Enchanter (like his healing song and his vision granting abilities), Billy becomes an extremely vulnerable target to anti tanks builds like Vayne even if he's granted vision of her chasing him down via passive (Billy might be able to land a stun or use the same ability to get away but Vayne will easily be able to hunt him down due to such jump dash being a moderate distance). Other major weaknesses to Billy would be projectile stuns like those found on Lux, Morgana, Neeko and Jhin (to an extent). Another counter to Billy would be Traps/land minds like Teemo's Mushrooms, Shaco's Jack in the Box and Jhin's Blossoming Lotus Traps. Finally, Dive champions like Gwen, Fiora, Camille and Irelia would also counter Billy due to Billy being a Tank in addition to their armor penatration and high attack speeds. Master Yi and Jax would also be counters if they build runes like Press the Attack due to their attack speed.


Curious what yall think about this idea regarding Billy the Blind Billygoat. Do you think there should be a support and or jungler built around a mix of crowd control and vision granting abilities or does that seem fairly overpowered, especially when Billy's moves set could lead to him being a pain to gank as enemy junglers if not hell if they attempt to invade or Ambush Billy. Yeah, it might be slightly ironic that Billy is a Blind Billygoat champion granting others vision though it plays off of the idea of losing a vital sense like vision and having your other senses like the auditory sense, develop and become stronger, using the sounds surrounding you to navigate in an echolocation manner. Alternatively, Billy's character design could also be fitting for an Anthropomorphic Bat (perhaps a Bat Demon from Noxus. Would be fitting, especially regarding the Q Passive with the bleed) or even a Minotaur to an extent due to the 2 horns. Either way, Billy would be a pretty fun Champion to play as either Support or Jungle.",1652690799

My team and I decided to give Clash another go last night after a few poor showings. We always enjoy the challenge even though we aren't the most cohesive team. But last night was an experience I have never had.

Started with a 13minute que, waiting to find a game. When we were finally paired with a bracket, our first game had a few Plat players (we are a silver average). This was fine as we didn't go in with the hopes to win, safe to say, we didn't. So into the losers bracket we go.

Our next match up decided to quit out giving us a bye and free win, so we proceeded to sit and wait for the other game to play out to find the winner and ay our final game. This was a 45min game that we sat and waited for. 

Once this game was done, the winning team, who was meant to play against us also quit, leaving us woth another free win, but a solid hr and a half sitting around, waiting for a game.

Is it common now for people to just quit out because  they don't come first? I don't understand the logic.",1652670614
leagueoflegends,Mid-Scope Update Appreciation Thread,"For the longest time, champions like Taliyah and Swain felt like they didn't even belong in the same game as the rest of the roster with seemingly arbitrary drawbacks gating their power while other characters more freely performed similar actions.

These midscope updates have done so much to address concerns that these champ mains' respective communities voiced and incidentally that I've personally constantly complained about, such as Taliyah's E feeling like half a spell that you almost never want to cast on its own without W.

Now with the update Taliyah is back in midlane and her spells actually feel like spells, she actually feels like a League of Legends champion. Instead of just a combo tool that only does ""more damage"", E is a really good zoning tool. Instead of worked ground being a frustrating punishment it's another weapon to think about during team fights, do I want my regular multi-hit Q or am I confident enough that I'll land the single CHUNKY one that I can afford to stay on this circle?

With Swain literally all they needed to do was let him be able to farm in mid without immediately running out of mana, that was the biggest thing holding him back from solo laning, and not only did they manage to do that but that ult? Bruvvv you feel like the centrepiece of the battle.

The thing about these updates was that they weren't necessarily balance changes, they weren't ""this champ is weak so we made them stronger"" but these were mostly quality of life changes that make the champ feel \*good\* to \*play\*, it removed the sense that you were being \*punished\* for playing the champs and somehow limiting yourself. I tried so many other midlaners while these two were nerfed and although champs like Vex and Seraphine were fun and all they just didn't feel as engaging as Swain and Taliyah. For the longest time I felt like I got locked out of what made me enjoy mid lane and I'm just really appreciative of the fact that they at all bothered to go back and rework these two champs in particular (which by cosmic coincidence happens to be my two highest mastery champs) to this extent, it's really cool.",1652669885

This is a kind of mindset a very toxic portion of Vietnamese netizens have, that as a Vietnamese, I really feel ashamed whenever I see them in international forums/discussions. However, this comes straight from the most prominent caster in the VCS (he‚Äôs like Phreak in LCS, a caster who has been in the scene since the very first day of League esports). 

As the VCS gains more prominent role in international League esports, I highly recommend all Vietnamese fans to stop this type of behaviors. Trash talking is fun, but insulting other regions and racism are terrible. The difference between those 2 are really clear. For example, Jankos got a whole lot of memes and even nicknames like long lost brother Giang Van Cot. That‚Äôs a really good example of trash talking. On the other hand, calling western analysts and casters ‚Äúhairy westerner‚Äù (Vietnamese racial slur for europeans/westerner) is horrible, especially coming from a person with such a prominent voice in the scene like Hoang Luan.",1652663632

Duo queue parity is a nice theory, but even if it works properly every time the game then becomes better duo wins. It's an all around feels bad man for solo players.

No matter how you slice it duos will on average, have more impact than solo players.  This isn't fair and shouldn't have a place in a competitive game like LOL ranked solo.

Duos are and always will be inherently unfair for solo players.  Even adding Voice Chat for everyone won't completely eliminate the advantage duos have over solo players.  Duo players almost always play champs that complement each other and they usually play these champs at a very high level because they main or even one trick them.",1652663041

leagueoflegends,Wordle-inspired game for item builds,"[https://leaguele.site](https://leaguele.site/)

Hey folks - I made a Wordle-like game to test your build-path knowledge. The game works like this:

* Try to guess the mystery item (you'll see the outline of its build-path)
* If you guess an item in the build path, it'll appear
* If you guess another item **whose build-path shares any items with the mystery item's build-path**, they will appear

You get 6 guesses (although there is an ""Easy mode"" for unlimited guesses  in the Settings options, along with an ""Unlimited mode"" if you want to  play continuously, rather than the default daily game).

leagueoflegends,"If there is too much damage in league, reduce the damage in league.","TL:WR Reduce item strength instead of adding champ defense and you solve the problems of too much damage, fed lanes winning games and stagnant build paths.

The plan seems to be ""There is too much damage in league, so we will give everyone more defense"" but the problem should be solved directly, by reducing the damage. Everything will need to be re-tuned around the proposed change anyway, so while it initially seems like a simple way to address the problem it's really just adding another complication. 

The item rework is what created this meta and its problems and it still hasn't been properly balanced. It put too much damage in the wrong hands, gave people too much damage too quickly, and gave abilities to kits that shouldn't have them. Item strength should be reduced across the board and every item should be re-examined with every option on the table, including removing them.

Putting abilities on items is very problematic and probably shouldn't be done at all. Eg. if a champion is balanced around low mobility having movement items in the game throws the balance off. The item makes the champ stronger, so the champ has to be balanced around that strength and then must be built that way. Even without abilities, a lot of items are just so good for certain champs that the champs are obliged to use them and are balanced around them. Sunderer is a prime example of this.

Reducing item strength also addresses the snowball problem much better than bounties do. The problem now is when champs with strong 1 or 2 item spikes hit those spikes early they are far too strong in comparison to everyone else on the rift. There is a place for early/mid game champions but it doesn't have to be the current feast or famine, be ahead and stomp or be behind and be largely useless. Bounties are a bandaid fix to the problem that created their own problems like champs taking top lane and completely abandoning it.

The main complaint I see with league now is that most games are decided by one lane losing so badly that even if the others did well they can't compete with the fed champ. Reduce the difference that being fed makes and you reduce that problem. The proposed changes will do very little towards that and will just mean another round of re-balancing round the balancing.",1652657236

leagueoflegends,I personally don't get why people are pushing for a double elim MSI,"First of all, given the general timeline for MSI, play-in and double elim would not be able to coexist due to the increased amount of games in double elim.

Second, if Riot does implement double elim, it would most likely not be a real double elim where the finals occur twice if the loser's bracket finalist beats the winner's bracket finalist in the first finals.

In that case, it would just be 100 times more unfair for the winner's bracket finalist, because they are the only ones who don't get the benefit of losing one game. Sure the advantage can be made up with something like side choosing in first game of the bo5, but that's just nowhere near close to being given another chance after losing one bo5. 

I agree that Riot needs to make changes, but I don't think double elim is the way.",1652656994

When the ""Major"" region that gets humiliated twice nearly every year can still hold a considerable win rate advantage vs minor regions, something needs to be done. I'm not much of a traditional sports guy, but don't most other sports have several tiers of competitive play? There should really be separate international tournaments for minor regions to pick just a few to go to MSI / Worlds. It just isn't fair for them to be the laughing stock of nearly every group stage ever besides like 3 teams across 11 years. 

Reducing the total number of teams at these events adds a small level of prestige, and makes larger, more honest formats possible as a side effect. The added tournament for minor regions also gives them more of a chance to improve based off what the top teams in other minor regions are doing; instead of being mostly locked to their underpopulated, and considerably lesser domestic environments.

- Group stage and rumble stage stay the same but are now Bo3 and single-round-robin so the teams play each other once.

I would also be fine with double-round-robin here but it might be too many games for the average viewer and it would be more expensive for Riot.

- Knockout stage now has double elimination so it would look like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Dual_Tournament_Format_Bracket_View.PNG). Double elimination is the most important change in my opinion.

leagueoflegends,Newbie question about top laners and their role in team fights,"What do we do exactly? Like what's our goal in a team fight? I used to main adc for a few season, but now I'm trying to learn top. Problem is, even if I win the lane, I often end up losing the game, if I dont snowball out of proportion.

Frequently I end up with top damage in my team but still lose. I dont blame my team for that, I just recognize I'm failing to play my role somehow. If I win lane and do carry damage, I should be able to win more games, that means I'm doing something wrong.

I think it's because I fundamentally don't really understand what role top lane plays.

For example, ADC is sustained team fight damage. As an adc i dont really have prio targets, unless they misposition horribly. My job as an adc is to stay alive and pump as much damage as possible during a fight.

What's my job as a top laner? Do I always need to flank? Do I need to peel for my adc, or kill their adc? Do I need to frontline instead of flanking? Help pls xD",1652649267

I understand that you can just mute pings but you can do the same with chat. That doesn't make it right to do so.

leagueoflegends,"A Message from Alex Francois, Global Head of Competitive Operations, Riot Games"," 

**UPDATED May 15, 2022**  
Following extensive technical evaluation of the competitive and training environments during the first three days of the 2022 Mid-Season Invitational, we discovered following Day 3 that there was a discrepancy in the latency being reported in game logs for all matches versus what was being experienced in the Busan venue. To address this issue, we are making a configuration change starting with today‚Äôs competition in order to reduce the overall latency to the intended level.¬†

Additionally, because this issue specifically affected teams playing from Busan, the matches involving RNG were held with an unintended disparity in latency between competing teams. As a result, we have determined it is in the best interest of competitive integrity to replay all three of these matches. These replayed games will be finished with all other Group Stage competition by Sunday, May 15; the replacement games will be held beginning tomorrow. We apologize to our players, teams, and fans, and we will continue to work with players to monitor the playing environments in our commitment to maintain the tournament‚Äôs competitive integrity.¬†

**‚Äì*****Alex Francois, Global Head of Competitive Operations, Riot Games***  


**Q&amp;A**

***What has Riot done to date to investigate this latency issue?***¬†

*On May 11, Riot was made aware of concerns from pro players questioning the latency levels of the competition following the initial games. We heard player feedback and began closely examining the data from our reporting tools. We also enlisted the help of senior Riot engineers from the League Development team who helped deliver Chronobreak and netcode improvements to conduct extensive testing.¬† We looked at server and client logs in an attempt to find any anomalous events or metrics. We also pulled together a structured Q&amp;A sheet and worked with the teams in an attempt to get more information that could help us narrow down where to look for the issue.*

*On May 12, we set up a test environment where we simulated the network environment from the event. In addition to looking at the networking code, we also started looking at the overall UI event loop (frame rate, game tick code) to see if the latency could possibly be related to something other than the core networking component. This is where we discovered an error in the calculation which was causing a discrepancy between the target latency and the actual latency experienced by players.*¬†

***Why didn‚Äôt Riot catch this sooner? Why wasn‚Äôt this tested?***¬†

*Riot performed extensive testing prior to, and during, the tournament, and our tooling and playtesting showed that there wasn‚Äôt a material variance in ping. However, after receiving more detailed player feedback, we designed and implemented custom debugging methods that identified our Latency Tool wasn‚Äôt calculating and displaying the correct ping value for players at the venue.*  
*‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã****Is the latency reported in game (ctl-F veroverlay) reporting correct numbers?***

*No, with the latency tool enabled, there is a bug which will result in incorrect reported ping. Players in Busan will have a reported ping that is approximately 13 ms lower than actual ping. So RNG players will see \~37 ms, and Busan players will see \~24 ms, but the actual latency will be equivalent.*",1652648339

leagueoflegends,Riot Games Apologizes on Weibo regarding MSI and Ping,"After LPL fans found out about 25 ping, Riot Games went back to their 13th statement and added a Q&amp;A to ""correct"" the issue stating it's only a visual bug. You can read the [Statement](https://www.lolesportsmedia.com/A-Message-from-Alex-Francois-Global-Head-of-Competitive-Operations-Rio) here.

After that, LPL fans found this move shady, they thought Riot was just trying to cover their ass.

Now, Riot Games on their official Weibo account posted this [statement](https://share.api.weibo.cn/share/306176933,4769600123961435.html).

Statement read:

We have heard concerns from players and fans, and we sincerely want to apologize for the disruption and frustration caused during the tournament.
In addition to our updated Q&amp;A which we have shared on our lolesportsmedia.com page, we are working on a detailed technical blog that will provide more transparency and intend to release it as soon as possible. We thank you for your patience and understanding.

LPL fans under this post are still questioning and flaming: why did Riot just post this on Weibo not anywhere else? Why did Riot post statement so late in the night? (4am local time. This is a tactic Weibo accounts would use, when celebrities want to apologize but don't want to contract too much attention and flames, they would do it at late night.)",1652648206
leagueoflegends,Garen's ult and w magic could be from Lux [theory],"So we know Garen's ult is magical, and I think his W also appears to be magical too since people don't just shield themselves without an actual shield. It is theorised his ult is actually him calling upon kayle, or him releasing stored up magic in the sword, or him using magic. 

The first is always a possibility. The third is unlikely as he has no training, and storywise it wouldn't be a great move to make him magical and also possibly more powerful than lux. So this leaves the second. Lux has shielding and light beam magic, which neatly coincides with Garen's shield and massive light beam sword ult. It would be cool if this is in fact lux storing her magic in his armour and sword. It would be cool in lore if between battles Lux would store magic like this, so if ever Garen came close to death or faced against a powerful opponent he couldn't normally defeat, he could unleash her magic and possibly save his own life and the lives of others.",1652647919

leagueoflegends,Nerf Malphite Q,"Malphite is insufferable to lane against as he has what is essentially the best poke tool in the entire game against melee champs, since it‚Äôs a homing attack which deals a fair bit of damage on top of it being unblockable as it can go through minions, and it is undodgeable and applies a slow. Basically if you pick before a Malphite and you chose a melee champ and some ranged top laners, you might as well dodge as it‚Äôs an pretty much an unplayable lane, kinda like Vayne top but worst, since Malphite is extremely tanky even when he builds full ap. So what I‚Äôm suggesting is simple, just let minions be able to block the q for you, this‚Äôll at least provide some counter play to it where currently there is none. Since right now all he does is walk up to you, Q then retreat back while you can get to him due to the slow; rinse and repeat until they‚Äôre low enough to dive or they have to recal, all the while you‚Äôve zoned them off of both of exp and gold.",1652647478

\- Hybrid magic/physical dmg that scales entirely off AD.

\- % true damage

\- Boosted crit chance

\- On hit effects

\- 3 of the strongest forms of combat mobility in the game

\- He has both hard CC and high mobility in the same abilities: Q and R

\-  His ult alone does knockdown, stun, and knockup all in a row, 3  different types of hard cc which can counter any number of things.

\- Cooldowns and casting animations that scale off of attack speed instead of CDR

\- Self shielding that scales linearly off AD and exponentially off # of enemies hit

\- Gets ghost, cleanse, and displacement immunity all in the same ability(not to mention the true dmg)

\- Manaless despite dealing significant magic damage and having a lot of spell like effects.

\- Probably some other shit I'm forgetting.

Am I insane for thinking this is way too stacked a kit for one champion? Nearly all the champions I play(mostly mages) don't even come close to half this many passives/perks in their entire kit. He gets the shielding and self peal of a support, the mobility of an assassin, the burst of  an uber fed artillery mage/jumpscare assassin, the sustained dps of a  bruiser, and the self sustain of a top laner if he builds anything even remotely resembling lifesteal/omnivamp. He does in 1 ability(soul unbound) what most other champions would have to use their whole spell rotation and both summoners to get close to.

Players  are punished nowhere near as hard for dying on him as opposed to any  other champ and get disproportionately rewarded for doing good or even  just neutrally ok given that he can build just damage, attack speed, and crit and ignore every other stat. There's a reason why you only ever see  shieldbow yones. That item gives them literally everything anyone could  ever ask for on that champ: more shields, attack speed, lifesteal, and  crit. Shieldbow is already a pretty overtuned item IMO but the fact that  yone goes from 0-50% crit chance after just that one purchase is an insane powerspike that I don't think any other champ comes even close  to(besides his int brother who gets the same crit boost). 

I already know Yone is a controversial champion in the community but I bring this up because I was reading through the wiki and noticed that just one of this champions ability descriptions is as long as 2, sometimes 3, ability pages for other champions. I understand that Riot's financials rely pretty heavily on making flashy new champs that are strong and have carry potential to bring in new players but that doesn't mean its always going to be healthy for the game. The main reason I think yone is an example of bad champion design is because you can be terrible at him and still get consistent value  because his kit does so many things that are valuable to a team as a whole even if the person piloting isn't very mechanically skilled. 

In terms of how to balance him, my vote would be for hybrid damage to be removed so that you could actually itemize  defensively against him but I also know that goes against his whole lore with the two swords so that's probably off the table. If anything else I feel like the inclusion of a mana pool would significantly balance out a lot of the extra stuff that he gets because ATM he has 0 resource management and can infinitely spam these abilities with paragraph long passive descriptions.

What thoughts do u guys have on this and other more recently released champions with large kits? What possible changes can you guys think of to help these things? What do you think it spells for the future of the game from both pro and casual perspectives? Should anything be changed at all or should riot stay the course they've been heading?",1652646088

But recently (like 3 months or so) every single time we loose the first game, our next enemy forfeits and we gotta either gotta wait an entire game, or in the worst case we just get automatically placed 5th. 

Please apply some kind of a clash penalty for this... Like if you forfeit while there are still teams waiting to play against you, the players are banned for the next clash weekend. Smth like that..

These champs are the ones that should really be up for a VGU.  It's not healthy to have champs that cause both teams to be unhappy.  I really think there should be a long hard look at changing these champs from the ground up.  Particularly Yuumi and Master Yi both champs are just pure toxicity in a bottle.",1652641531

leagueoflegends,Client UX needs better direction,"So this is a bit of a rant mixed with some hopefully helpful feedback.

The league client in general is the obvious weakest point of playing league of legends. Functionally, it can best be described as ‚Äúusually works‚Äù and from an experience perspective it can best be described as ‚Äútedious‚Äù

It is visually cluttered, slow, and not optimized for its primary purpose - starting a game of league of legends.

I played around 20 or so matches to feel out the new end game screen and it‚Äôs just - infuriating. I don‚Äôt WANT anything that is there. It‚Äôs okay to gamify progression, COD does it well, League doesn‚Äôt. 

I feel like the RIOt UX team needs to just see what the market leaders are doing and do that, their innovation/execution or whatever you want to call it on the client right now is bad.

Like overall when you zoom out and think about what the client is experiential let for the leader of esports, it‚Äôs bad.",1652640660

leagueoflegends,Is there anyone who *doesn't* reach honor level five?,"I just saw the new recall players who reach honor level five (it's on SkinSpotlights for anyone who hasn't seen it yet). It's really cool that Riot is giving players better rewards for receiving honors in-game, but I never considered honor levels to be anything special. My duo and I usually reach level five after a few months by simply honoring each other most games (I don't get honored by other players much as supp, so he usually hits it a few weeks before me lol). A big reason why I was so dismissive of honor levels is/was the lackluster rewards, but also because it seems like the sort of thing you're eventually going to get regardless of whether or not you're actually a consistently good teammate. I've seen toxic players get the most honors on their team because they got fed and carried, or the enemy team misplayed and let them split push to their nexus. 

So I guess my point here is, doesn't everybody hit honor five by the end of the season as long as they play regularly? And if the majority of players are going to get the recall eventually, why should we care about it? I don't mean to come across as ungrateful, it's great that Riot is giving us some treats. But a big part of the honor system is getting players to behave themselves by enticing them with rewards you can only get by earning good boy points; I dunno if a recall that a lot of people will have by the end of the season will do that.",1652639666

I am also missing challenges from the MSI event, which is confusing considering it's still ongoing, and I wouldn't be alone if this were the case. I went to go complete it and it disappeared for me after the second match I played. 

On a side note, I also believe I had been given a  High Noon skin before the challenges appeared and don't know how to see the challenge for that anymore, as well as the fact that I might have dissolved it for essence? 

I have the resources for the refunds or repurchase on all of these items but there is a larger log of events after all of the problems that have kept occurring, so it is not a simple account rollback that would fix this.

I would also like to know which folder Challenges data is saved in in case I can delete it to make them redownload and reappear. My Windows 10  seems to sometimes mark things as read-only or error with the built-in folder protections so it might be my end that's locking up.

leagueoflegends,Here's why the Olaf changes ironically make him a worse top laner,"Quote from patch notes -  ""These changes should not only help better define Olaf‚Äôs identity as a Berserker but also allow him to take a new place as a viable top laner.""

To introduce myself, I have mained Olaf top since S3 on various accounts. I have consistently held a 60%+ winrate on him at around D1/Masters ELO. The last time I played was grinding ranked a couple seasons ago on a fresh account I was at one point around 60 wins 2 losses queueing solo. I ended my run in grandmaster at around 70% win rate overall before quitting ranked. I say this not to brag but to give credibility to my understanding of what made Olaf one of the best top laners in the game. (Better than his jungle)

Olaf's strongest aspects as a top laner (Before change)

\- Early game kill potential. By running ghost and going all-in with Q you could get first blood about 90% of your games at lvl 1-2.   
**After update - Q cooldown is much longer, base damage lower, as well as a longer minimum cast range. This combined with the cooldown only being allowed to reset to 3 seconds significantly hurts his all in potential. The passive change also obviously hurt his early game dueling potential against bruisers that would commit back to you. from 100% max AS Lvl1 to 40% max.**

\- W sustain. If you managed to get a kill lvl 1 and survive with low HP you had the option of taking W lvl 2 and life-stealing most if not all of your health back in 1 to 2 W's. Or you could all in your laner when they TP back to the minions while you're below 50% HP getting a 2nd kill at lvl 2.  
**After update - You can no longer do this, his overall sustain seems cut about 60-90%. The old W mechanic where all healing was increase the lower you got made Olaf feel like a Berzerker he doesn't feel like this anymore early/mid with the AS changes and healing changes, they aren't nearly as impactful. W shield is a joke early/mid unless you are near 30% hp.W now has a auto reset built in. This mechanic is somewhat useless because you would always follow your auto up with an E to reset/Make use of his auto CD.**

Attack speed/Tower killing. - As you got your early lane advantage and kept killing your laner you had easy access to their Tower plates. You would intentionally keep your hp low to get a bunch of Bonus AS for taking plates. This combined with your W attack speed and 6 second duration meant you could secure many early plates or a whole tower.  
**After update - Passive gives less attack speed/ W duration cut from 6 sec to 4 sec as well as less attack speed. These changes make it significantly harder to take tower plates and snowball. Not only due to the reduced attack speed but also from the reduced ability to kill your laner.**

\- Duels top lane LVL 6 and on. Due to his 6 second ult duration and 6 second W duration you could easily duel just about any melee top laner since they had to commit at a close range for around that duration before one of you would die.  
**After update - W duration reduction/Ult duration reduction. The ult being reduced from 6 to 3 is a massive hit to this aspect of his laning. 1v1's/1v2's would rarely last much longer than the 6-second Ult/W duration. Yes you can refresh the duration with Auto's or E now but it isn't as strong as you'd think. The duration can only be extended by another 2.5 (This effect doesn't stack) It only refreshes. You would normally use your E right after an auto when engaging the fight. At this point you only have your auto's to refresh your ULT duration. If the enemy flashes or gains any distance from you your ult will now be useless. You can no longer use the ult Bonus move speed to run at them, by the time you get to them after their dash/movement your ult will now be gone. You have to wait till you are on top of them to ult which means you are open to being cc'd. Another overall nerf to his kill potential in lane.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Areas where Olaf is now stronger**

Mid late / Late game - Olaf is pretty well known for falling off extremely hard, win rates showcased this as plummeting after a certain point in-game. Put simply some of Olafs power has been taken from early snowball potential and put into his MidLate/Late post-lane potential. Although it seems like this might only be the case vs certain comps that can't kite him. If the enemy team can wait out his 3-second ult duration then he is rendered useless and in a 200 YEAR gameplay meta champions should easily do this. He has always operated as a team fight disruptor diving damage soaker or as a Peeling tank shredder.   


Overall I'd say he can do these jobs better because your ULT MR/ARMOR stay up even when activated. This allows you to get away with dropping a tank item for a damage HP item instead of an HP/RESIST item. Allowing you to dive the backline with more Damage and same tankiness in theory (Although overall ability to drain tank has been significantly reduced). I used to be able to heal from 10-30% to full in 1-2 seconds with VISAGE/Ravenous and W, No longer as easy. 

Your Q armor shred WOULD be the best part of this buff except for the fact that it seems like nobody plays tanks (I haven't been around much lately so idk). as a late-game disruptor you would try to land Q on as many of the enemy team as possible if you engage - Pop randuins on entire team - Pick up axe again... throwback towards your team through them... rinse repeat. Armor Shred on Q makes this aspect much more potent. So against the tankier teams specifically this is a insane buff which pushes his identity as this type of teamfighter which is very unique and I have always loved about Olaf.

Again these buffs don't matter VS 200 years gameplay champs because they can just go Perma Invis or 1000 Teemo distance dash away during his 3 second ult duration. (I barely want to admit but I think this makes Olaf a lot more healthy, although I genuinely think 3.5 or 4 seconds is more fair)  


A couple of things riot said this change will accomplish in patch notes does the exact opposite.

Riot - ""These changes should not only help better define Olaf‚Äôs identity as a Berserker, but also allow him to take a new place as a viable top laner.""

As I explained these changes make him a worse top laner. I believe they also kill some of his Berserker identity and give some with the Infinite Ult possibilties. They took it from his old W that increased healing when lower and suddenly giving your lifesteal and a bunch of AS. This fulfilled the Berzerker identity... Suddenly turning the tides with rage when all seems lost. Now his passive is just some permanent lifesteal and lower AS. Leaving Olaf more like a fighter and less like a Berzerker. The W shield quite obviously doesn't fit with Olaf's Berzerker identity and I've seen a bunch of Olaf mains agree with me.  


 ""UPDATED PRO AXE JUGGLER Picking up axes now fully refunds **Q - Undertow**'s cooldown, but axes can only be thrown a maximum of once every 3 seconds. (Note: The 3-second limit scales with Ability Haste.)""          **MINIMUM RANGE** **~~300~~** **‚áí 425 units**   


This change also kills Olafs identity as a Berzerker and takes away the fun mechanical expression Olaf had. Even WITH 50% CD you can't juggle axes nearly as fast (So why call it ""PRO AXE JUGGLER"" just call it noob axe juggler please) This was a beloved feature of high skill Olaf players who were able to Throw Q through the enemy and weave in Auto's as you pass cancel with E pick up axe repeat all with high AS. This feature is dead and I'm not sure why they killed it.

&amp;#x200B;

What I think Riot should do going forward with Olaf. 

For the love of Olaf mains please let us juggle our axes. Riot has completely gutted this feature.

Lower the ""axes can only be thrown a maximum of once every 3 seconds. (Note: The 3-second limit scales with Ability Haste.) Perhaps to 2-second limit scales to .5 seconds or 0 at 100% Ability Haste  
You used to be able to have it on a 0-second CD with not much CD! Why nerf it so hard?

Maybe even lower axe CD from 9 to 8, 8 feels extremely unforgiving especially in top lane.  


Change ult so that your first auto and E ""INCREASE"" his ult duration by 1.5 each to 6 seconds. Not refresh. Beyond that keep every auto and E as refreshing his ult by 3 seconds.  
This or maybe change his ult duration to 3.5 or 4 seconds. (I'm not 100% sure a change is needed here yet)  


E is fine always has been, we love it. Don't touch it.

Maybe build a passive feature into his W where ALL healing and Shielding on Olaf is increased as he gets lower down to 30% HP. I'd be ok with weakening his shield to be able to keep this old feature. We loved it, it was where most of his berzerker identity came from.   
It doesn't have to be much. Maybe even just make it so all healing and shielding are increased on him while his ULT or W is active? there are many options here to keep this identity.   


Overall I truly believe Olaf is in a healthier state now, these changes are in the right direction, and I'm generally happy.

leagueoflegends,Regarding MSI's ping controversy: Riot secretly modifying their statement to cover up their incompetence,"For those who are still following this circus of an international tournament, we are already familiar with the controversy surrounding MSI's ping issue and RNG's rematch. Then, Riot made an announcement (13/05) regarding this issue. The original version of the statement did not include its current last part, where the controversy surrounding 22 ping seen in T1 Zues' pov today (16/05) was explained with a Q&amp;A about why artificial ping cannot be correctly reflected on players' screens. Multiple proof is provided below. 

Personally I cannot understand this secretive editing. If a new issue is raised and the audience is demanding new answers, I believe the correct way to address is to make a new announcement. Editing your previous statement without public notification for this edit seems like a really convenient way to hide the real problem under the rug and avoid responsibilities. The effect Riot has achieved here, whether intended or not, is that when part of the audience ask for answers, others can point to this edited statement to show that they have already ""addressed"" the issue before and throw more fire to the flame, while in reality it is merely a poor attempt at covering up. 

Personally I feel this is a severe breach of trust for your audience and I am deeply disappointed. I believe proper explanation for this entire issue is needed, yet I might only get another edit. 

Proof 1: [Web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lolesportsmedia.com/A-Message-from-Alex-Francois-Global-Head-of-Competitive-Operations-Rio) shows that the website was edited on 15/05 and the change was captured at 15:08:29 GMT, which means that roughly the edit was made before 16/05 12AM Korea Time. This corresponds to the finishing time of Group A's games on 15/05 night and the timing when the controversy just blew up. 

Proof 2: I have had doubts that the web archive might not be accurate. Then another unintended archive showed up. Doublelift looked through Riot's original statement when it was first published during his streams. The stream clip clearly shows that the last part of Q&amp;A explaining why artificial ping cannot be correctly reflected on players' side was not published in the first version on 13/05 when he was reading it. 

Both above can prove that the last part of the current version of the statement was edited after first publication. For what purpose and at what exact time, I do not know. I do not wish to make false accusations here so that's the best I can leave it. 

The above events really confuse me. I understand that the ping issue is closely related to competitive integrity which should always be upheld, but this is exactly why all issues related to this should be openly and clearly addressed. Beating around the bush is only causing more damage and divide amongst the league community, which should never be the result of an international tournament. 

I am making this post hoping someone can bring light to my doubts. Please do not attack any individual, org or region in the comments. I cannot do anything if you do but it really hurts to see them. Thank you for reading thus far.

Everything started with me joining the lobby and claiming mid since no one claimed that lane yet and the first thing that I see is akali typing REPORT \*username\* OR FF AT 15 and then REPORT \*my username\* OR FF AT 15... didn't understand what was happening, but I just ignored it. Then the game started and akali was like chatting with the other team saying stuff like yasuo report ekko (me) and lucian (the other dude she wanted to report) for ""stealing her lane"" I told them that if she had just  told me or at least asked I would have given her the lane, but she just ignored me and kept sabotaging the whole entire game.

She stole my farm and didn't even bother helping me kill yasuo even when he was low hp, went bot stole lucian farm even when he was already struggling with 2 vs 1 and didn't even help him one bit, sabotaged yi our jng by telling them when we went herald or drake, in short the whole game was a mess.

Akali kept acting like that the whole game until at 15 she tried to make us ff, but we all voted no saying that since she was the one that made the game shitty, she would have to endure it with us till the end... only after the 3rd try to make us ff she stopped helping the team. We still ended up losing, but at least we weren't the only one wasting our time.

Now the funniest part is both yasuo and teemo from the enemy team enjoyed akali playing style and both said they would report me... I understand that winning is fun, but what is the point of winning if you enjoy playing in this shitty way.",1652630163

So RNG players will see ~37 ms, and Busan players will see ~24 ms, but the actual latency will be equivalent.

leagueoflegends,Is there any place where I can play on a curated solo queue environment like Champions Queue?,"Basically title.  

I'm a veteran player (playing since season 2), and I've played in a ERL in the past. I had to stop given personal reasons, and now I don't have the time to commit to a team again, but I still play a bit every week.  
Competitive League is my favourite game, and unfortunately, it is completely different from solo queue, mainly due to the lack of voice communication, as well as players that do not care.

I've always hated soloQ, and have no desire to play it due to the amount of trolls or people with weak mental and huge egos. I also have no desire to reach diamond again, since I've done it in the past and see no personal gain in it anymore. I just want matches with good quality, and I feel like soloQ **heavily** fails in that department. 

So my question is: is there something out there, like a discord server, with an internal soloQ ladder handled by a ""queue bot"" or something, voice communication, and where trolls get kicked out, like champions queue?

Thanks!

After a while it just stopped happening as suddenly as it started ( November 2021), and now it started happening again. The weird thing is that despite it happening on my client most of the time I have no issues while in game. Although its rly hard to get in game cause the messages keep resetting the queues and are also causing me to dodge many times. Has this been happening to anyone else?

leagueoflegends,MSI best team and ratings after the Group Stage,"Hey guys,

I usually post ratings and stats after every gameday here: [https://twitter.com/KCBstats](https://twitter.com/KCBstats)

I wanted to share my statistical player rating model for the MSI after the Group Stage is over.

Two considerations before the full post: 

1. It's a fully statistical model, there's no subjective opinion in it. In any case, stats are not the whole picture and there are many other factors to take into account. My intention is not to say that the players on top are better but I believe that the model is decent enough to post it and professional enough to get a good general idea of the player performance. Of course, everyone has his own opinion (including myself) and I'm not going to change that :)
2. Take a look at the minimal difference between Xiaohu, Caps and Faker, just 0.47 points, so it's pretty much a tie and any of them could be 1st, 2nd or 3rd.

Here's the key to the ratings:

As someone who loves aiming for challenges I'd highly appreciate if all challenges requiring specific champions could get a tracker as the system is already in place it doesn't seem like it would be that much additional work.

When 5 people huddle around in the circle if looks kinda awkward and more so the backs of the players are shown to the camera instead of their faces, you cant see the emotions of players and the shots for the camera crew is harder to capture aswell.

leagueoflegends,Riot's refusal to change tournament format,"Another year, another great set of suggestions from reddit about how to change MSI format / worlds format and once it again, we probably won't get any change next year.

It's really sad that Riot has consistently chosen the worst possible formats to host their international tournaments, both for minor and major regions.

This MSI, we got to see minor regions get stomped continuously by major regions, then probably get stomped again in rumble stage, why does this happen? Because minor regions have only ever upset lower 3rd/4th seed teams from major regions, almost never 1st seeds, so why have them play against 1st seeds at all?
Either:

- hold a mini wildcard tournament to determine which wildcard gets to rumble stage, this would be exciting because wildcard vs wildcard can often be close

- invite lower seeds from major regions, LGD and MAD struggled against wildcards, because they were 4th seeds and not the strongest representatives of their region.


Likewise, last worlds, we got unbalanced groups (as always), and saw some competitive teams eliminated before playing any bo series.

When will Riot accept that:

- bo3s are objectively the best compromise between a too long series and a much too random, and sometimes meaningless bo1. Refusal to leverage bo3s has been Riot's biggest mistake

- we need to closer games

- we need less meaningless games, but more games between closer skilled opponents, NA vs EU bo5 has happened about once, over the past 3 years. We tend to only see best vs the best more, which is going to be LPL vs LCK and sometimes EU.

- fans don't want to see their teams eliminated without playing a bo series, it sucks for the teams, it sucks for the fans, please make tournaments more bracket-centric than round-robin-centric.

- group stage should be used for SEEDING, not eliminating teams, especially when pools are NOT balanced, and teams are RANDOMLY selected into each group. One exception maybe the last place team¬†can be eliminated, 3rd place teams in groups have historically been very decent and you could see them compete against 2nd seeds in other groups.


I know this is going to be just another one of these posts but it just baffles me Riot for many years we have been refuses to implement any changes that can only boost viewership and help their revenue, make the teams happier and fans happier. This is pure self-sabotage.",1652625142

Fakegod was released on April 28th leaving the team with and opening for top laner. Though Dig will need a resident top if they stick with Blue and River which seems the most ideal at the moment and look at that Gamsu is already a declared North American resident from his time with Dignitas back in 2014 with CoreJJ(ADC). I think this might be a shock to a lot of people but he was looking good in Academy. Also there is no buy out for a declared resident that has LCS potential. This also aligns with the the logic of adding another Korean to pair with river to help him adapt to NA and in their environment. 

(Context Note)

Gamsu was a profession Korean league player(Top) from 2013 - 2016 most noted for coming over to NA to play on Dig with CoreJJ(Back when Core was an ADC).  which was a large failure that probably had a lot more to do with the org then the players. So after a year with Dig he went over to EU to replace Huni at Fantic when Huni &amp; reignover left for NA Immortals. He never really lived up to the hype during those years but with the amount of challenges that he had to face during those year it not a huge surprise. Though since his Departure from League Gamsu went on to play Pro Overwatch until 2021. That is when he came back to NA League of legends and join up with 100T to be on there amateur team and then in the most recent spring split that just past he played for the Academy team.",1652622858

I can see the potential merit, but there's also a reason for the past several years there has been a wild card bracket first. 

It's not fun or exciting to see teams so humiliated on stage. It is a sad way to cap off a whole split for these teams and the regions they represent. I really hope in the future this format doesn't return.",1652618070

leagueoflegends,This whole ping situation has really gotten way out of hand,"In one of today's games we saw a player proview (Zeus) where its shown his ping is around ~24ms. The first complaints about the ping on stage were that the ping was shown as about ~35ms but felt way higher. Several pros including, Impact, Yaharong and others have said that in their interviews.


In Riot's [statement](https://www.lolesportsmedia.com/A-Message-from-Alex-Francois-Global-Head-of-Competitive-Operations-Rio), they said they took measures to fix this problem. It's fair to infer that even though the ping shown on screen is about ~24ms it should feel very close to 35.


However, the complete **lack of clarity** from Riot's statement about the way they fixed the ping has made the fans that watched today's games totally confused, and cause a lot of people to storm the LoL Esports Twitter questioning why was there a player playing on supposedly 24 ping.


This whole situation feels so messed up, and also the player/team in question is getting attacked in social media because of the lack of clarity in how Riot has technically handled the ping fix.",1652617480

leagueoflegends,What would be the strongest meta if Summoner's Rift became a 6v6 map?,"Some years ago, Riot implemented Hexakill for a limited amount of time but because of that I think people just played it for fun without developing particular strategies. Now, imagine that Riot decides to do it again but as a permanent change with current champions, items and mechanics.

I think the strongest comps that would prevail are: 1-\[2top-1jgl-1mid-2bot\], 2-\[1-top-2jgl-1mid-2bot\] and 3-\[1-top-1jgl-2mid-2bot\]; in other words, no lane with 3 people because exp would be too low (although I might be wrong) but I really wonder about the roles and the specific champions.

1 - I know that when the general best current lane distribution was yet to be discovered, people used to go top with 2 tanky bruisers/supports so Taric/Braum/Leona immediately came to my mind, but maybe it would be better to play another adc+supp there too (in that case at least one of the supports/jungler should go tank to have a frontline).

2 - Two junglers would have a very powerful pressure everywhere because they would be very strong in ganks (4v2/3v1 or split and gank multiple lanes) or while invading and taking objectives. This is probably the strongest comp, in my opinion.

3 - Two midlaners with 2 strong roamers would be another option with a nice pressure potential, while 1 stays in lane the other attacks somewhere else with the jungler or alone while the jungler attacks the opposite lane.

The number of variables is huge and I'm curious to see what you think :)",1652617203

leagueoflegends,MSI 2022: Minor Regions Fail to Get a single Inner Tower in 20 Games v Major Regions in Group Stage,"I put together a little table [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jXQ9CjI) of how many and which towers each minor region team got in each game during the MSI Group Stage against EG, RNG, T1 or G2, the major region teams.  As you can see, not a single minor region team got more than 3 towers in any such game, and not once did they get an inner tower.

I think this shows the format had too many games with too great disparity in skill level, and future formats should try to reduce this to maximise entertainment.  That said, EG and G2 only played against 1 minor region team (Order, a combined 8 times) so it'll be interesting to see if Saigon Buffalo or PSG can do better against them in the Rumble stage.",1652615638
leagueoflegends,Client is starting to become unstable for low end PC,"Dear Riot,

I know you've been working hard on the infamous memed client, but I think you've been doing too much:

The beauty of league was its accessibility and it being able to be run by low end computers as long as you had a stable wifi connection, but after the client updates, it has been unstable and prone to having to load for 10 minutes after booting it up compared to the old 2-3 minute before the updates.

All I want is for the option to use the old client without the extra cosmetics as it seriously damages the experience, not only on the client but also during champ select as the champion icons don't show the actual champ that's written underneath and it does sometimes cause me to pick a champ that I didn't pick.

The client updates are beautiful but it has also ruined my experience with the game, overall it's a good change for the percent that can afford to upgrade their computers, but for the latter half it becomes a hell of loading screen and not being able to see the icons for the majority of the content.

I find that not having the ability to talk to myself, while not toxic in itself, reduces the chance of me raging at my teammates and my computer.  I don't exacerbate my situation by stimulating the emotional parts of my brain.  This will cause me to shut the fuck up finally, and also focus on the gameplay and what I am doing wrong in game.

leagueoflegends,Skill comparison between NA and KR solo q after the streamer invasion,"To start off I want to disclose that I have played extensively on both servers: over 800 games on each server through a wide variety of elos.   


Micro: I am living in Korea and play on the NA server with friends and 200 ping. My mechanics are better than people within my elo despite the huge ping difference. I would say that the difference in mechanics is at least a whole tier (plat-dia etc.) You hardly see high skill champs being played poorly mechanically. It goes without saying that they are better laners and team fighters.  For context, I used to consider myself to be a player with slighly below average mechanics in NA(compared to my elo)  


Macro strengths. Koreans seem to be way better at playing within vision and engaging fights. They are better at exploding leads. They are better at diving and controlling baron fights. They are better at recognizing important threats and recognizing flash cooldowns. They also have far better map awareness.   


Weaknesses: They have HUGE EGOS. Most of their outplays and misplays can be attributed to their egos. They do NOT like getting carried or playing weakside. They shut down and tilt easily. Their BIGGEST weakness BY FAR is side wave manipulation. Because its so ego driven, they have developed this culture of fighting and ignoring waves mid-late game. This is the biggest reason their macro suffers. Despite them being great at exploding leads and making them bigger, they WILL try to 1v5 and throw away their leads because of egos. Even if they pick split pushing champions they will often simply look for picks all game. When you occasionally find teams that are not ego-driven, you can tell they actually can have great macro. These games definitely exceeded what I was used to from NA but its not the norm.  It is safe to say that you have more agency in NA with the nature of the slower paced games and more humble players.   


Streamers and Pro players: 

The majority of streamers that have come to Korea have stagnated at around 200lp lower than their elos at home.   
TFBlade at 860 LP after 800 games dropped quickly after pro players started playing and coulnd't maintain top 3 for very long despite being a rank 1 in NA and EUW.    
TheBauss had a hard time staying in challenger and stayed within 600-650 lp despite easily achieving 1100lp+ at home.    
Katevolved has consistenly stayed within 960Lp and 1230 Lp at home. As of now, it is pretty safe to say that he has peaked in Korea with a 54% winrate after nearly 500 games at around 650 lp    
The same can be said of Nemesis and Midbeast though I doubt I have to elaborate there.  We will have to wait for Tyler peak to make an assessment there. 

All in all, it is hardly ever the case that players that come to Korea match or exceed their previous ratings. We can only conclude that Korea is the better server. The main negatives are their terrible attitudes and huge egos.",1652613051

Obviously I started losing a bit more and got back to plat 4 50 pl

The thing is, I played a couple more games, lost 2 on a row, and got matched in a SILVER 1 - GOLD 4 GAME!

leagueoflegends,Champion idea (sorry if this isn't this correct place),"Name: Digit
Type: Fighter/bruiser 
Lore: One of Piltovers training hand to hand training robot, which became sentient after a nearby electrical explosion which short circuited his hardwire. (Similar to that which vi/powder use a punching bag)

Passive: Go Go Digit Arms
Digit's robotic arms are detached when using abilities, causing his auto attacks to deal bonus damage but become slower as kicks are used instead of punches, and after 3 auto attacks his arms return to him. Gaining a small spell shield and attack speed is returned to normal. 

Q ability: The big combo 
Digit launches his rocket powered fists (skill shot),  the first shot is a a right arcing skill shit (similar to Diana Q) that if hits slows the target. 
The second is a repeated shot but from the left. 
If both shots hits the same target the is rooted and Digit can cast this ability a third time to magnetise his fists andfly to the target reconnecting his arms and dealing a devastating 3rd attack.

If his arms do not hit the same target, his fists are returned. 

W ability: Defensive stance (Garen shield)
Passive: Gain physical magic resistance 
Active: Gain more armour and magic resist for a duration.

E ability: Flurry
Digit throws a flurry of rocket punches in a 360¬∞ circle around him, slowing any targets hit. Digit can reactive this once more in a target has been hit. 

R (Ultimate): Final round
Digit throws two long rain straight punches out in front of him in quick succession, if it kills the target, the punch continues of it trajectory. 



Sorry for any spelling mistakes, the idea came to me as I was falling asleep and I've wrote this on my phone. 

I kind of pictured the training dummy vi and powder use in arcane, but a better one as its in piltover not zaun. His fists are detachable like Rayman (game from years ago). 

Sorry if this is wrong place!

leagueoflegends,Heimerdinger needs a rework.,"The reasoning for this is simple, in my opinion, but I see almost nobody talk about this champion - likely because of his playrate - but I really do feel like this does need to be touched on. 


There is no champion in the game as uninteractive as Heimerdinger. Almost every champion in the entirety of League, as salt-inducing as some may be, can be played around. With Yasuo, you poke their shield out and dodge the tornado. With Tryndamere, you try to stop him from building fury, or even with Master Yi you can CC him or try to burst him out. When you play against Heimerdinger, the obvious course of action is to destroy his turrets, but they're deceptively tanky and you'll usually get shot once or twice while doing so. Then, when it's destroyed, the cooldown is relatively low and it will just get replaced. This leads to an uninteractive play pattern of permanent pushing, regardless of your lane opponent. It is antifun on both sides of the lane. The Heimer player does very little, aside from replace turrets and take a few potshots with W or E, whereas their opponent just accepts their fate to farm under tower until their team comes to intervene. This is why Banner of Command and ZZ'Rot Portal were removed, yet there is a champion centered entirely around that style of play. 


In comparison to other mid and top laners, there is so little going on. Against a Fiora, you make sure to keep your vitals safe while trying to whittle her down and bait the parry. Against Darius, you have to make sure you don't get hooked or hit by the outer edges of Q, keep your bleed down and look for favorable trades when he uses those cooldowns as you kite them out. Against Yasuo, you have to dodge the tornado and pop the shield with autoattacks, alongside baiting the windwall and ensuring that you don't get dashed on with your positioning. When playing into a Heimer, however, you effectively resign all proactive authority you can have on your own and just farm instead of playing an enjoyable game of League of Legends.


It's due to this uninteractivity in lane that I would propose Heimerdinger needs a rework, because a champion like him does not belong in modern League of Legends. In modern league, the ability to interact with your opponent is where the vast majority of the gameplay comes from. Let's use the Urgot rework for example - he went from a champion that point and clicks a bunch after one skillshot that nobody played into something where you need to position yourself carefully to use your shotgun knees, which on it's own changes the game drastically. Take into account the W toggle and the rest of his kit and you have a champion that interacts a lot at all points of the game, feels relatively nice to play as and doesn't feel blatantly awful to play against on a base level. A rework like this would drastically help Heimer - it would very likely make him much more fun to play as and against, which in turn would shoot his playrate up and potentially encourage people to try him out instead of seeing a champion where something you place does 75% of the work for you and you don't really do much. I know I wouldn't be against the idea of playing a big brained mad scientist who's inventions do most of the work, but in his current state I have no desire to play as or against him.

To throw a potential idea out into the open, maybe Heimer could have a Charge meter on his turrets, in which their damage or attack speed is affected by how long they've been on the field, and this could be replenished over time by champion combat. That would ensure that Heimer at least has to try to fight in lane and do something that enables you to consciously make a trade instead of feeling resigned to the jungler's whims - it forces him to play aggressive to keep his push going, which in turn enables you to make a trade outside of the range of his turrets once in a while.


Of course, it's certainly not the best idea. I thought of it on the spot while I was writing this, but I do understand that Heimerdinger players likely enjoy their turrets. To keep that aspect of him, though, something needs to be done to make sure that the Heimer player has to be active in lane. Forcing him to fight to keep his turrets at full potential (maybe with a higher ceiling than now, as I don't wanna straight up nerf a champion that already sees very little play) would ensure that you can occasionally fight him once your wave builds up instead of it being pushed into tower forever.


Obviously, Heimer isn't overpowered - but with the Udyr rework coming up, I'm almost 100% certain that Heimerdinger is the champion that least fits the game - he's uninteractive to play as and against due to the turrets, and goes against what seems to be Riot's design philosophy going forward - lately, it's been more and more action, frequent roaming is encouraged and a fast pace is also pushed. Heimerdinger removes the ability to play a game with any of these things without being severely punished until laning phase is over. Turrets and an AoE stun discourage proactive gameplay, roaming leaves you with half a turret the second you leave, and the game is reduced to a snail's pace as the only thing you can really end up doing is occasionally clearing a turret and farming minions under your tower.


Sorry for repeating points a bit too much - I wrote this at 352AM, so it might be a little more incoherent than I hoped, but the point remains - Heimerdinger does not fit in modern League of Legends, and I really hope he's slated for a rework soon.



TLDR: Heimerdinger does not fit in current League due to his turrets encouraging a constantly pushing playstyle with little interaction - the exact reason why Riot removed Banner of Command and ZZ'Rot Portal, and as such should be reworked to encourage proactive gameplay during laning.",1652609079

leagueoflegends,RNG Plow Through MSI‚Äôs Group B,"Well, I called that RNG were the favorites in Group B but dang did they steamroll.¬†¬†

The results are in for Group B in MSI and despite some issues, RNG managed to sweep their group without dropping a single game. PSG made it with a 3-3 scoreline. Unfortunately for the RED Canids and Istanbul Wildcats, however, their runs end here. They got 3rd and 4th respectively, but definitely had some good showings. Hopefully we‚Äôll be able to see them in future international competitions!¬†

The first three days of competition were mostly uneventful save for ping issues brought up by the pros in the venue. Riot were able to fix the problem, but requested for RNG to replay the first three matches citing competitive integrity as the main factor as their opponents were playing on unstable ping.¬†¬†

Now, I‚Äôm not here to put out an angry post on the issue or blame teams/pros. I do think this is a really big mess up from Riot that resulted in a lot of vitriol online. I‚Äôm really hoping that issues like this get sorted out on the first day of competition next time or even better, beforehand.¬†

That being said, RNG definitely proved that they were the best team in the group by far and do deserve to make it into the rumble stage. Heck, GALA got not one, but two pentakills for this group stage! No one else in this tournament managed to get even one yet. They played a total of 9 games including the ones that were remade. The subreddit is calling those games non-canon now which I find to be pretty funny. Regardless, at the Rumble Stage, I‚Äôll definitely be expecting them to top the group along with T1. It‚Äôll be great to see these two orgs face off against each other once again! Especially since both teams look to be in top form.¬†

Hopefully we‚Äôll be able to see more rare picks from RNG as well, like GALA and Ming Tahm/Senna bot lane pick. Something we haven‚Äôt seen in a while!

Also Xiaohu vs Faker? The current best midlaner in the word vs the greatest League player of all time? Yes please! The narratives are hype this year!

leagueoflegends,"Lux support is not good, and has never been good.","From a concerned ADC \*please\* stop playing Lux support. Its \*not\* good, it has in-fact always been her worst role compared to Mid. She has high mana costs and very specific burst thresholds she needs to reach without items. Lux is more of an Assassin then a mage, and has poor poke in a duo lane due to having to trade autos with (2) champions when trying to proc her passive, which accounts for an enormous amount of her early game damage. 

Unlike someone like Morgana or Brand, Lux has very low base damages and poor utility since Lux's shield just kind of sucks, since its slow and not very reactive. Lux's strength relies entirely on landing the Q, E, R combo with an auto mixed in-between for a passive proc. She cannot just land a E and chunk someone like Brand with his W/Passive or Morgana Q/Pool. 

The only reason to play Lux support is if you KNOW you're going to win lane. (like Vs'ing a Vayne, and you have a poke ADC). Since a fed Lux support is quite snowbally once she reach's her burst thresholds.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Lux support is bad, has always been bad and is worse then every other High damage mage support, unless the lane is a guaranteed win. Play Lux mid if you want to play Lux (She's quite good there if you can properly trade passive auto's. And can go toe-toe with most Assassins if you can save your Q and burst them if they dive.)",1652607274

leagueoflegends,Heimerdinger Needs a Rework.,"I'm gonna be honest, this post is partially fueled by salt, but I feel like it needs to be said.

Why the FUCK is Heimer allowed to exist in the state he's in? I don't even care about his strength level. He genuinely should just be straight up disabled until Riot reworks him. Even old-ass champs like Udyr allow you to even try to play or some shit, or laning against a midlaner like Yasuo or Yone or something like that, you can dodge the Q, run away and attempt to survive. They don't kill you by just passively existing. Heimerdinger needs a rework before anything else happens, because while every other champion is in some way, shape or form interactive, Heimer can just remove the interactivity from the game altogether. Against a Yasuo, i'm constantly poking, removing the shield, trying to ensure that I don't get hit by the tornado, etc. Against a Xerath, you have to constantly dodge, but if you can close that gap and his E is down, you get your turn. 

Heimer doesn't let that happen. He sets down his turrets, automatically pushes faster than almost every laner you can play, and turns his brain off, ironically. The fact that he has actual abilities on top of it rubs insult into injury, because I see Heimer players just brainlessly throw them in my general direction while I'm left to cope under my tower, trying to cs while being pelted by turret fire while Heimer stands borderline still as he has the game played for him. You're supposed to interact with the turrets by killing them, but by doing so you just eat 3 shots from them while you do so and come out behind in health, and he'll just place another and resume standing there. It's so fucking boring, even if you can just farm and outscale. As the Heimer player, I can't see how it'd be fun to just place turrets and permanently and automatically push and against Heimer it's not fun whatsoever to just accept that you're going to have to farm under tower unless your jungler is going to gank you and hopefully manage to kill him before the turrets shoot him to death. Lane bullies are fine, but a character that literally just stands there as auxiliary turrets shoot you to death and give him the credit is fucking stupid. Playing into Darius, it's a careful spacing game, where you have to not let his E land and to avoid his attempts to run you down. Against a Viktor? Dodge the E to the best of your ability, don't let him get quick Q trades off, etc. Against Zoe? Dodge star and bubble, stand behind minions, punish when she overextends. Against Heimer? Sit there. Try to kill his turrets as he keeps replacing them while you're slowly pushed to your tower as nothing else happens. The game is reduced to farming under your tower and waiting for your team to make any plays. It is not interactive on either side. As the Heimer, you're barely playing proactively - you might ward here or there, but for the most part, you just let your turrets do everything and maybe land the occasional skillshot. Doesn't really make a difference, unless it's RW which is almost never used and you just save for RQ instead. Laning against him? You can't fight him while his turrets are there, so you just keep destroying them as he replaces them and they just shoot your wave down and occasionally poke at you until you go absolutely fucking insane waiting for something to happen.

After remembering what it's like to play against a Heimer, win or lose, he's just going on the permaban list. I might lose to shit like Yone missing every q and killing me with double crit, but I at least know that I could have not overextended, or dodged the ult, or SOMETHING. With Heimer, it just sucks any fun out of the game. Today was the only time I have ever yelled at a video game, even while winning, and I really can't justify why Riot hasn't done anything to rework him. For all they speak about interactive champions and reworking dated kits, Heimerdinger is an outlier, with nothing slated as far as I can tell and by far the least engaging gameplay experience on both ends in the entire game, to the point where you can play him with one hand and not really care too much. It's absurd how this champion hasn't been reworked in all of their years of existence when it actively encourages uninteractivity and permanent pushing. Isn't this kind of shit why ZZ'Rot and Banner of Command were removed, too?

Sorry about typing so much here, but after that experience I just had to make this post and sort of vent and ask why Heimer players actually enjoy the champion. It feels like the only reason you would play them is because you're a sadist and you wanna watch a TV show in the background or do your taxes or some shit while also playing league. Even Yuumi has to look out for being knocked off of their champion, aim Q's, use their passive shield, all that stuff, but Heimer just drops turrets and pushes for existing.


Can anybody actually give me a good reason Heimerdinger does not need at least a mini-rework to make playing as and against him slightly more interactive?",1652606463

Is this person in charge of making these Decisions, or are they simply the person announcing them?

Why, after multiple decisions this person has made/posted - that have had lots of negative feedback - is this person still in a position to make Decisions regarding the game? Did his boss fart on him at work or something?

But I feel like the players they play against are often times just way above the mmr we're playing at. Like for example yesterday I played with 4 friends and all of us played on unranked-low gold accounts and our midlaner who wanted to try playing mid for the first time was unable to even go to his lane because his lane opponent had 10-11cs per minute in 2 games we have played.

The thing is that when they are queueing for themselves they will find way weaker players and they even have very good kdas.

I feel like I'm playing on very low accounts already, is there still a way that I can play with them to maybe teach them a bit and so that their enemy isn't way above their level?",1652601230

And I know that the rumble stage is where the ""real tournament"" begins, but either way, this is still a stain on competitive LoL.

But I don't even think it's that much of an outlier. There has been a lot of disappointment with international play over the years, and it feels like this tournament is simply the culmination of all that. People want more international bo5's and matchups in general, and seeing time being wasted on matches like these instead just feels terrible. It wouldn't be so glaring if it wasn't like 20% of the international play we'll get in 2022.",1652601167

leagueoflegends,"Im having hard times in Ranked, any tips?","&amp;#x200B;

I know winning lanes doesnt garantee victory.

Helping your team with TP, farming well, leaving your laner behind is the least you can do in the early game. But i literally keep losing, and losing and losing.

I dont want to blame my team, but 15% winrate isnt just trash of the trash?

Im getting very tired, I want to know how you guys actually win without picking hyper carry champs...

I feel like a clown right now.

leagueoflegends,End of Season Reward should be a Victorious Skin Token.,"Getting a Victorious Skin for your main is the dream of many players... but some people will never get to have this victorious feeling, because this game is 13 years old. There are people in high school who were not born when this game was released, and that means that they will never be able to get a victorious skin for their main if they released a skin for it when they were 3 years old.

Imagine if at the end of the season, they gave you a Token as your end of season reward where you could redeem a victorious skin of your choice. Either get the one from this year with all the chromas associated with your rank and everything, or get one of the base version of one of the old ones. 

There's nothing more disappointing then grinding all year long to get your reward that is a skin for a role you hate, so this could be mitigated to a degree. And for the people that got the original skins on the first year, they could get some flair for it like Championship Riven got for her skin when they released her from the vault, be it a crown, a chroma and/or a loading border.

Also, with a specific goal in mind, more players will have an incentive to play rank as a lot of people I know don't bother to play rank, because they don't want to go through the pressure of ranked only to be disappointed by an end of season reward they don't care about.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR Version: 

\-Victorious Skin Token to redeem a victorious skin of your choice

\-Old Victorious Skins get the Championship Riven treatment to make original owners happy.

\-More incentive for players to rank because they are sure they will like their end of season reward.

\-End of Season reward disappointment will be mitigated by a lot for the vast majority of players.

\-People who's main got a skin 10 years ago before they started to play the game will get a chance to experience the joy of playing with a victorious skin on their main.

leagueoflegends,Seeking Champion Advice,"Whats up y'all?

I'm looking for advice on champion selection. I am a gold ADC, and I am very proficient with many ADCs. Almost all my time has been spent on marksman Champs. Half of that has been on vayne.

I hate playing support or tanks. I am looking to learn a second/3rd role, mostly jgl and mid. I am having trouble learning these roles while also enjoying playing to any degree. It seems to be because of what champion I am playing and finding out how I win games on those champions. I am noticing that I may like Champs that are able to maintain distance and do dmg, but I dont think that is going to work in jgl. I am thinking maybe kindred, graves in jgl, but im all over the place with mid picks. I dont know how to win games with Champs outside of late game scale and stall types.

What Jungle and Mid champs are recommended both for learning these roles and to fit my playstyle from what one can gather from my description? Any contributions are appreciated!",1652596139

leagueoflegends,One person can cause a chain of dodges without consequence,"Someone can first pick yuumi jungle and cause repeated dodges without any consequences. It just took me like an hour to get into a game after people repeatedly dodged one player who just kept troll picking every lobby.

It was obvious that player was the reason for all the dodging.

I'm not sure what the solution is. If someone gets reported in the lobby for refusing to play at least a semi-meta pick 3 lobbies in a row which results in a dodge, maybe that player should be punished.

leagueoflegends,UPdate after 7 lose streak as support,"Update, game 8 as expected a lose game, Mf adc fed 15 kills and never was in any teamfight for the rest of the game, only clearing Jg camps, Trundle jg never used smite so Gp stole our baron and 2 dragons with his ult at this point is not even fun, I have chat restrictiong for 3 days probably gonna lose my account at this point.  


Playing support is the worse thing i dont know how someone climbs from fucking silver when you get teamates like these, there is no point en even trying because im sure ill get more trash teamates, I ping them to fall back, MF pushes and gets ganked and killed, respawn and rinse and repeat.  


At this point I rather troll and int my way to Iron IV and sell my account to one of those sites atleast ill get something besides trying to climb wich is near impossible",1652593809
leagueoflegends,Laning Versus Lucian,"This post especially, but not exclusively, refers to the Lucian + Nami bot lane combo. I just don't understand what I can do as Jinx adc. Assuming my support isn't cooperative (as usual), my go to move is to simply last hit and let the wave push to my tower. But with how much distance Lucian can cover with his dash and Nami's speed boost, I can't even farm safely. And all this is BEFORE Lucian's galeforce and his ult! 

Im a Jinx otp and my gold elo supports aren't usually very helpful, so please avoid the ""choose a different champion"" or ""ask your support to..."" advice. I'm not even trying to win lane at this point, but just survive so I don't have to keep wasting my ban on Lucian.",1652593621
leagueoflegends,"[BREAKING] After 60 years, the first match between G2 Esports and T1 in the 2022 MSI Semi-Finals has been concluded","The 2022 League of Legends Mid-Season Invitational in South Korea, with respect to the LPL representatives Royal Never Give Up (RNG)'s unfortunate situation whom cannot travel, has been implemented with a ""35 ms"" ping delay for all contestants in order to make the tourney fair for RNG. 

However, quickly after the tournament's first few matches, many players have gone to express their concern on the ping delay, claiming that it's in fact much higher than a mere 35 ms.

Riot Games, the company responsible for the tourney, claimed to have handled the situation, but as the days went on, it felt like the delay only seemed to increase. 

Fast-forward 60 years to today, 2082, where the first match between the LEC representatives G2 Esports against the LCK representatives T1 has finally let down its curtains. The match ended with all 10 players stuck in fountain whom none have had their champions move an inch due to the unbearable lag, all as the minions had their great lag-ridden war against each other to decide which team came out on top. Fortunately for T1, they were blue side.

Sadly however, as the match took its end, pretty much nobody was there to view it. You see, League of Legends died out completely a few years after the tournament began, root cause being the game actually deleting itself entirely after a bug was uncovered following the Cafe Cuties x Noxus 2 event that has been connected to the notorious bug-filled champion known to be Mordekaiser, specifically his previous champion iteration. Luckily for the tournament though, it still ran on the same patch it began on. 

As said before, nobody was there to view the match, all except for one, David ""Phreak"" Turley, former American play-by-play caster for the game who has reportedly came to the MSI studio everyday for 60 years straight just to watch EU fail with his own eyes. He claims this is proof that EU is just as bad as NA, and that NA still has a chance to prove themselves in the future given a pinch of luck with their used-to-be famous Evil Geniuses team that has disbanded as an organization several decades ago. 

This is all to naught nonetheless, because the winners of the tourney have already been decided in favour for RNG back in 2022. There was controversy that followed, but it became overshadowed and eventually forgotten due to the uncovering of a video that included former TSM owner Reginald chasing former TSM midlaner Bjergsen around their gaming house with boxing gloves.",1652593554
leagueoflegends,Looking for a main,"I‚Äôve made several posts about this already, slowly playing and listening to everyone replying, getting several answers and suggestions, and I‚Äôve come to realize my biggest issue - the fact that I didn‚Äôt know my playstyle. I‚Äôve gone over some of my clips and realized that I‚Äôm a highly bloodthirsty player. I flank constantly, try to get kills as much as possible and punishing mistakes. Any champs that support that kind of playstyle well? I also like outplay potential on champs like zoe and zed. Those are the two I cater to the most.",1652592929

leagueoflegends,Giving Riftmaker the old gunblade active (zap slow) would be healthy and good for the game,"Gunblade from a couple of years ago had an active where it zapped the target, slowing them and doing a small amount of damage.

Putting that active on Riftmaker would allow for more playmaking ability for several champions that require kiting to do damage. It also increases counterplay by allowing champions with limited movement abilities to potentially get away. 

Now more than ever, items allow champions to make more impactful plays situationally. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Everfrost - shoots a cone of  damage that stuns people in the middle, and does damage. Good for engaging and used on Veigar, Ahri for example.
* Hextech Rocketbelt - has a dash active. Strong on champs that already have dashes, like kat, Diana, Akali.
* Stridebreaker - kills the movement speed of anyone that gets nearby. Cripples any chance of escape by anyone nearby. Even flashing away might not be enough in some cases.
* Galeforce - allows champion to dash forward, and shoots three missiles that damage nearby low hp champions. Allows for far more playmaking ability on champs such as Trynd.
* Prowler's claw - dashes through target.  Champions that were previously limited in mobility can take advantage of this, such as Sion or gankplank (although not currently meta on them).
* Chemtank - speed up towards target, followed by damage burst and slow.

Removing the gunblade active completely removes any counterplay some champions might have otherwise had. Simply standing in the wrong area can become a 100-0% hp 1 shot, where otherwise an escape could have been possible.",1652584139

leagueoflegends,AP Hybrid Volibear with Lethal Tempo and Hullbreaker is the new Inting Sion strat. And Lethal Tempo combined with the upcoming durability changes will make it even worse.,"**Voli gets rushes Nashors, and then builds into Riftmaker, Deaths dance, Hullbreaker, and other hybrid resist/damage items**

And then he just runs at people and towers all day, disregarding deaths just like Inting Sion and then killing people under disabled towers or breaking towers at mach speed due to his attackspeed plus AP

&amp;#x200B;

His ultimate disables then damages towers which scale off his AP, and his attacks deal bonus against towers due to the AP he builds. (Not to mention his passive gives him more attackspeed for the AP he builds)

&amp;#x200B;

As for 1v1s, Voli can just jump and disable towers while beating people up at over maximum attackspeed. **Combine that with hybrid damage, shielding, healing, and a bunch of E-HP and there are almost no champions who can beat him in a 1v1 due to his sheer tankiness and DPS**

&amp;#x200B;

**Half the problem is because of how broken Lethal Tempo is as a Rune.**

**Lethal Tempo already breaks the ""rule"" of runes.**

Runes are either high damage/impact with a long CD (ex: Electrocute, hail of blades, aftershock)

or low impact/damage with a long term gains (grasp) OR consistency (like Conq and PTA to some degree)

**Lethal Tempo is both high impact and low CD/very consistent**. Giving extremely high amounts of attack speed and champs can consistently stack it/maintain it considering time it takes to fall off and the extra range it gives.

**With the upcoming durability changes plus Lethal Tempo, these champs will have a much easier time getting out attacks and become 1v1 monsters** before anyone can do anything about it.

**Champions like Jax, Kayle, Vayne and the aforementioned Volibear**

And its not just them, champs like Sett, Trundle, the windshitters, Irelia, and a ton of others will abuse Lethal Tempo even more.

Before Lethal Tempo, a champ like Pantheon, Renekton, or Garen, had a chance to beat them in a straight 1v1. Being able to burst them or at least get them low enough so that they can inch out the last bit of HP to win the fight as their opponent starts throwing out attacks at mach speed. 

**Now with Lethal Tempo, these fights are nearly impossible to win** because the opponent just gets so much attackspeed that they outdps anything that tries to 1v1 them.

**The entire fight is lost because of a single rune, how fun is that for anyone who doesn't use lethal tempo?**

&amp;#x200B;

**The second half of the problem is the durability changes,** 

I think these changes are good for the health of the game but it will push high dps champs (like lethal tempo users) over the top. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The rune itself needs to be reverted back to its previous state or be hard nerfed or else 1v1ing these Lethal Tempo users as a non-Lethal Tempo user will be nearly impossible for 95% of the champions**",1652582720

leagueoflegends,What do you think is the main current issue of Annies gameplay design in terms of pickrate?,"So far, I think her design is okay at most, especially on paper, she fulfils the usual traits for a Burst Mage, needing to find the right opportunity to burst down her opponent and not much else.

But I feel like that there's something wrong with her kit, that rubs me the wrong way, espcailly with her abysmal pickrate.

Sure, she's supposed to be the symbol of a Beginner Mid Lane pick, and thus could be written off as boring to play being the reason.

But there are other Recommended beginner picks that see a lot more play compared to her, even in both lower, and higher ranks, such as Yi, Garen, Miss Fortune, and Ashe.

Not only that, but even compared to other Burst Mages, Annie is rather pretty dang unpopular compared to someone like Lux, Brand, Vex, or even Veigar.

I personally feel like Annies main issue, is how lacking of a neutral she has even compared to other mages or beginner picks, since she can be easily punished for making a bad decision, especially due to her stacking mechanic, the opponent has a good time window to punish her easily if she isn't fully careful, since she lacks range, or even reliable defensive options.

Because of that, it kind of makes her a bit clunky to play, and in my opinion, not as well suited for a beginner pick.

What do you personally think?",1652573031

I think personally this is incredibly dumb, now you have to save up 125 ME and wait for leaks to hopefully announce your main or such are getting a prestige skin. KenAdams also is the person behind the event changes (the changes that made you have to gain points to get the pass tokens which INCREASED THE GRIND) and advocated for 195000 RP prestige skins before having to change it to be 125 ME due to backlash.

leagueoflegends,I climbed from gold 4 0 lp to Plat series with an 80% win rate. Then immediately upon losing plat series 2 wins 3 losses I could no longer win games playing the same strategies before. One thing changed.,"How did I do this? Let me start by explaining that I am not a smurf. I am just a hardstuck. I did reach Diamond in seasons 4 - 8 sure. But I was one tricking the old Akali. Due to RL I decayed out of Diamond in seasons 5-8 but i've added some other images to prove I got diamond those seasons. Since then i've never gotten higher than Mid Platinum.

So Sure I was good in the past but now i'm a washed up hardstuck.

So How did I do this? Well It is simple. I believe due to overwhelming evidence that Matchmaking differs depending on how much LP you are getting; and it is especially prevalent since smurf que was added. I'll Elaborate.   


If you're getting 10-13 LP per win your Elo/Mmr is arguably lower than your LP. What this means to the system is that You are NOT a smurf. You be matchmade in well balanced winnable games if you are getting between 10-13 LP.   


14 LP - This seems to be the middle point. Games are not as easy but it does not seem like smurf queue happens yet or very often.   


15 LP Per win. You will be matchmade with smurfs often. Just Mild Smurf que.  
16 Same as above  
17 Lp Per win. Coin Flip Smurf Games often.  


It was always very easy for me to get platinum in the past But since the matchmaking changes in season 10 where Rito ""made the climb longer"" [https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/lol-devs-explain-season-10-ranked-climb-longer-1330270/#:\~:text=After%20one%20player%20called%20out,climb%20%E2%80%9Ca%20lot%20longer.%E2%80%9D](https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/lol-devs-explain-season-10-ranked-climb-longer-1330270/#:~:text=After%20one%20player%20called%20out,climb%20%E2%80%9Ca%20lot%20longer.%E2%80%9D)  


\^\^ After the season 10 matchmaking updates I seem to have a very hard time. What happens is I go on win streaks like below and then get put in some very horrendous matches afterwards.   


This is not the only time ive climbed with a similar win rate like this.   


In fact anytime im in gold 4 gaining 13 or less LP Per win I will win 70% or more of my games until i start gaining 14 or more LP all the way to Platinum. Usually I get stuck around Plat 3 But the same rule holds true if I get low LP gains in Platinum.   


As long as i'm gaining 13 or less LP I will climb to plat 3 series to Plat 4. But otherwise I don't climb easily. I can still climb but it will be like at 55% win rate.   


TLDR - If you're gaining 13 or less LP Per win games are easier to Influence and Win. Since The Smurf Que / Matchmaking updates of season 10 and 11 I can not win streak a whole division unless i'm gaining less than 13 lp per win. I've done this at least a dozen times from low gold to Mid Platinum.  


Currently I'm stuck in Mid Gold getting 14-16 per win. 

If you want to repeat my success I suggest you play Top Lane and play a champion that carries team fights to victory. Its free Lp.   


PS. The thing that is really lame about this pattern is it basically encourages you to lose games to lower your lp gains.   


Matchmaking update / smurf que did some weird things to the ladder.

leagueoflegends,Why is Annie's low playrate not being addressed?,"As it stands Annie has averaged about a 2% pickrate at all ranks for multiple patches now. She's one of the least deeply played champions who isn't some niche pick or just balanced around having an elevated skill floor/straight up pro-play. She's quite the opposite of both, she's accessible and consistent in her intended role yet no one wants to play her. 

I've said many many times in the past, my pipe dream for Annie is for her to receive a Pantheon/Warwick level VGU that reimagines her in a way that makes her more engaging and thematically sound while maintaining her entry level skill floor. Do not give me the rhetoric that Annie's gameplay is ideal because it's easy. Imo, there's no value in an easy champ that no one wants to play even if it's help them learn the game. Nunu and  Warwick are perfect for people to learn the jungle role for example and they're actually popular as hell. Lux, Veigar and \*especially\* Vex all offer a similar experience and gameplay fantasy while being more engaging for players.

I'm not sure what riot thinks of Annie's state, but from the outside in and someone who used to enjoy playing Annie, she feels very... lame. Not bad, just... lame.

Now my question is this, in a hypothetical life or death situation would Quinn bathe in the blood of virgiins (bathing in it naked in a tub basically) if it meant it would save her own life? Now normally the thought of bathing in virgiin blood let alone blood is gross, so it would be a turn off to many people in Runeterra, but in this specific scenario where it could potentially save Quinn's life, would she do it?

leagueoflegends,Does League have too many comeback mechanics?,"After watching EG vs G2 where EG closes a 9k gold difference in moments after one misplay by G2, I couldn't help but think that the game is too unforgiving for the winning/leading team. 

Having a bounty because you have more CS than your lane opponent, or enemies still getting objective bounties when you are down on gold but up on dragons feels unfair. It feels even worse when you are ""punished"" for winning lane against a counter pick, or when your team loses the lead after outplaying your opponents for 95% of the match. 

Of course, there should be some comeback mechanics, but right now it feels like one mistake can instantly wipe away any lead that you had.",1652559681

I mess up once and the opponent team is getting back in the game.. Sucks big time when they are actually teaming up and get stronger then my team mates. 

Shouldn't it be the way that when I reach 4 full items I would be able to spread my gold over my other team mates? As most of the times in these games where I end up getting very strong it makes me feel like I'm in a 1v5.. This way atleast my team mates could start and make a change.",1652559269

leagueoflegends,"Playing since 2012, I need help.","I feel I need to explain my history a little before I ask for help directly. I've been playing League off and on since Zed was released (I began during the patch he was added). That's getting close to 10 years. I've not been a consistent player, I only had two or three ""bursts"" of time where I heavily played, in 2014-2015 and in 2019. 

2019 was the first time I properly tried ranking, and ended up coming in at Bronze IV or V, thanks to some great teams. I've mained Shyvana since 2014, and tend to perform best in tankier roles.

I am *awful* at the game. My cs is routinely the lowest or nearly the lowest in a match. I've done countless hours of cs drills in the practice tool, where I can get pretty good at last hit, then the moment I get into a game I get bullied out of lane, frequently dying under turret as first blood, and snowball negatively from there. When I teamfight I get stunlocked and melt, without fail, or I hang back too long and die anyway. Very occasionally I will do *ok* in an ARAM, but I'm usually a C to D- player in the stat screen. 

This consistent failure has pushed me to try my hand at the bots, thinking maybe I'm just too stupid to pvp. I've racked up a lot of time in bots games now. Except I'm running into similar issues there too. Intermediate bots, I usually end up like 3/4/8 or something. Beginner bots, 3/2/8. I see people in every single match in both levels that go 35/0/1 constantly, and I can't comprehend how anyone can do that. I've been trying for a decade and still barely do anything. The only way I can break double digits is to go into *intro* bots, which is infested with player bots already.

What am I doing wrong? I know I have poor reflexes and map awareness, something I've tried to work on for years but only seems to get worse. I ward well. I borrow builds from the internet. I play champs I'm accustomed to almost exclusively. I have rough ideas of what enemy champs can do. I have the game at 60fps, my ping is 30ms or less constantly. Whenever I try to play, sometimes my abilities don't go off when I click, there's probably a 0.25 second delay, but often it doesn't seem like that's actually on me. I used to play frequently with people in Gold+, so it seems my MMR assumes I'm also Gold? But then wouldn't I be able to beat the bots?

I'm frustrated. It feels like no matter where I go, I'm useless. I get so thoroughly thrashed that I can't even register what I did *wrong,* if anything. I play to my best ability and get flamed for intentional feeding no matter what. If I focus on cs, I get ganked and die. If I try to fight, I die. If I stay under turret and farm cs there, at 6 minutes a Yone appears next to me and omae-wa-mo-shindeiru. I'm not even playing the game at this point, I'm just there so the enemy has an easy target.

Are my reflexes and eyesight just so bad that I *can't* play the game? I can't even process how other people manage to dodge many skill shots, because I can't even dodge most slow ones. I can't track what's happening when there's so much on the screen. I can't see wind-ups, can't see abilities coming, I don't even see what kills me most of the time. Am I just doomed to fail? I like the game, I want to be able to play it, but as things are now, I'm little more use than an intro-level AI player, and that's not fun.",1652556045

leagueoflegends,"New Champion idea: Luan, the Assassins Counter","The design idea: Ixtal Champion, also feline/cat-vastaya like Rengar     
The initial idea was to create a support champion that specifically counters Assassins- and Ambush-Champions, especially those who can go invisible. Invis/Camouflage/Stealth has no real counter ingame other than a pink ward that can be destroyed, so champions like Evelynn, Rengar, Kha'Zix, Shaco, Twitch, Viego, Teemo, Akali... etc. with decent skill can be an absolute menace to the game. It is even more frustrating when you are fighting champions that can go invisible multiple times during a (team) fight (Ability or Duskblade) and get untargetable. 

*Luan was the runt of their tribe and had to be the victim of all hunting games of their brothers. Instead of learning to become a hunter, they taught themselves to evade and avoid their brothers, who all became expert hunters.*

Name: Luan (Melee | AD)  
   
**Passive - Nine Lives:**  
For every Kill Luan gains two Stack of ""Nine Lives"" and for every Assist, Luan gains one Stack of ""Nine Lives"".   At nine stacks, Luan gains the ability to evade lethal damage once and resets the stacks. 

  
 **Q ‚Äì Pounce:** (Targeted ability) (CD 7-3 Seconds)   
Luan jumps on an enemy Champion, briefly rooting them for 0.5-1.5 seconds (base on level) and dealing 50-200 (+45%AD ratio) physical damage. If Luan jumped over terrain or over another Champion, the enemy is stunned for 1-2 seconds (based on level) instead. If pounce is used over terrain or another champion, the range is doubled.  
For every successful pounce over terrain or champion, Luan gains one stack of ""Nine Lives"". 

  
**W ‚Äì High Alert:** (CD 10-5 Seconds)   
Luan prepares for any ambush and gains 30-60 movement speed (based on level) for 3 seconds. Additionally, they gain a 70-120 shield (+20-35% extra health ratio) for the same time. If ally champions are nearby, they gain the same amount of shield (Auto-Atk range//100-120 range?).   


**E ‚Äì Elusive:** (Timing ability) (CD 15-10 Seconds | active for 1 second)   
If Luan is struck by a melee ability while Elusive is active, they evade the initial damage and kick the attacker away (50 ingame units). If Luan is struck by a ranged ability while Elusive is active, they receive reduced damage (10-35% based on level). For every successful evasive maneuver, Luan gains one stack of ""Nine Lives"".   


**R ‚Äì Sixth Sense:** (CD 100 -50 Seconds)   
Luan pumps up their senses and gains the ability to spot enemies, large monsters, and monsters from far away. This includes invisible and camouflaged enemies or those hidden in the bush. All spotted enemies can be targeted by Luan.   
Passive Ult: Something wrong! Luan gets alerted when enemies are close by which they cannot see. (Range 1000 ingame units)

They could make the computers in LAN just run through several miles of wire to introduce the correct ping the old fashion way.

leagueoflegends,Why do people quit league? Should I?,"I use it to fill the inner emptiness inside me, when I can't see progress in my life, because I'm not grateful enough for everything I do to get closer to my goals or I don't set enough goals or negative people drain all my positive momentum. Whereas farming waves, getting objectives and good plays in league are instant gratification. It's ironic, that I only enjoy hypermobile champions who can usually go back to safety without consequences.

Winning makes me lose my overall interest and motivation, because it doesn't mean anything to me and I feel like I just wasted my time, because the progress towards learning a skill from winning is supposed to be equally important to what I learnt from losing and making mistakes. No wonder people are toxic, if the values of the game are misleading. Too often you are being punished/rewarded for 30-45 full minutes, regardless of how you did individually compared to your past self. 

Maybe I just needed to went, but I'm concerned whether playing this game is worth my time. Is any of you awakened about this yet? I get Fight Club vibes from the immature people in it, but that might not mean that it's destructive, if we can pursue what builds our confidence in real life. League is not just a cult to feel like we are included in something bigger right? It's fun because it's challenging!!! The problem is putting it as a priority over more meaningful connections and challenges. I guess I have to trust the slow progress I make in life to speed up eventually and stop killing time with LoL for no reason, then it will be fun. Less is more.

leagueoflegends,Skill Level vs Champion Difference,"Just going to say out front that I don't think I am very good at the game as I have been in Gold/Plat elo since Season 5.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to create discussion about what I think makes the game the hardest, i.e., the difference between the skill level of a player and the strength of a champion.

&amp;#x200B;

I would argue that everyone agrees that League is a massive game, and that there are so many things to improve at, e.g., farming, kiting, pathing, etc. Therefore, you can be someone in Silver elo, but have some skills at a Gold or Platinum level but other skills at a bronze level. At the end it balances out somehow for the rank that you eventually get stuck at.

&amp;#x200B;

It frustrates me that someone can have equal if not slightly better skills than another player, but still lose simply because of the difference in champions. Some champions are just so strong in this game that sometimes it feels like you need to be smurfing to win. This ""strong"" champion can be different for everyone depending on the lane they play.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is mostly in the lane. At least of me it is. Does anyone experience this? It is frustrating to me. What are some tips for learning to play around these champions that steamroll over you, especially if you make even just one mistake? Which champions do you struggle with?

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I find it so odd that champions like Garen are so tanky, hit so hard, and all while rushing boots first item. The same can be said about Yasuo and his damage; it used to surprise me that he would get berserk and suddenly his damage just spiked.",1652549884

leagueoflegends,Esports Capsules dropping from MSI Capsules,"With MSI approaching I was hyped to get new emotes because in general they really grew on me after I collected a bunch. When emotes launched I wasn't attached to them, but with time I really liked to express myself ingame.  


That being said, I sort of became an emote collector over time. Last years worlds and the recent spring season had so many drops that I was able to reroll and get all the ""available"" emotes for free.  
So I'm quite happy for that, but it also sparked a sort of addiction.  


My disappointment kicked in when I realized the MSI event loot assets weren't on live yet. That meant on the first days of MSI we didn't get MSI capsules. With the patch being live a few days now I manged to recieve the new MSI drops.  


My understanding of the situation let me forgive Riot for the late MSI drops, but now I wanted to get the cool new stuff.  
Then I opened my first MSI capsule just to get a **normal Esports capsule** from it...  
In a few others I got grey icons and only managed to get a Shaco and Rengar emote so far when I've watched every single game.  


**So why did I make the post?**  
Basically to express frustration and question Riot, why they still insist on giving out old content when they have new emotes already. Not only are the grey icons kinda boring and lifeless looking, the choice to put Esport capsules inside MSI capsules has to be a joke. I probably collected 100 or more emotes from the capsules since Worlds and I have a huge overflow too. Why would anyone still need old content, hasn't everyone gotten so many emotes that they just disenchant them?  


My suggestion would be to make old esports emotes rerollable once a new batch comes out, but then you should only be able to drop the new ones. Even if they include boring grey icons, atleast the rewards are fresh and you aren't getting spammed with old content.  


What is your guys thoughts about this, do you see an issue similar to me or am I just overreacting out of emote addiction?

leagueoflegends,Done with League,"Hey guys and gals,

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to share this post in case some people need to read it.

&amp;#x200B;

Been playing this game for about 6 years. I've had more frustration than fun. My favorite champions are either situational or not viable top lane (Loved to play Maokai, Nautilus, Gnar). Recently within the past two months I made it a plan to climb to platinum at least, but to no avail, I can't seem to climb over gold 3. I've remade a new account to climb solo for this, but again, it's just not possible. Either I tilt hard because a teammate is inting, or I lose lane from some mistakes in laning phase that I make and the enemy top laner solo carries the game. I think I'm officially deleting league from my pc and retiring my accounts. It was an okay run and I don't think the new damage changes are going to positively affect the game. Have fun and best of luck to all players in their climbing endeavors.

For me, it's Rakan. A lot of times people forget that Rakan is an enchanter with enough dashes to be the slipperiest thing you've ever witnessed- only getting doubled down by the fact that he embraces running it down with a charm slow that feels like you just got Nasus W'd.

leagueoflegends,Kaisa feels really bad on the PBE right now maybe catch bot lanes in general," Kaisa Nautilus, Kaisa Leona and Kaisa Blitzcrank can no longer one combo the enemy ADC on the PBE right now unless they have a massive lead already. It's a joke how else does a low range lane like Kaisa and a catch support compete with say Caitlyn Lulu or any other high range poke lane? The threat of an all in kill is what allows a ""catch bot lane"" like Kaisa Naut Leona or Blitz to play the lane at all.  Haven't tried Kaisa Pyke yet would be interested in hearing from those who have.

Now before someone just says the PBE is unbalanced, OK sure but here's the thing.  Me and my support both hit every ability, this is a raw burst damage thing not a skill thing.  If the enemy ADC or squishy support get's hit by the CC into all of Kaisas burst they need to either have flash or be dead.  These engage supports are supposed to be very high risk high reward, but the reward for hitting a hook needs to be massive IE it needs to be a kill.

I expect this will affect other ""catch bot lanes"" such as Draven or Samira with any of these hook champs.  Enchanters are already way too strong right now and this new patch is going to be a big buff for them because the weakness of enchanters is that they're squishy.  This patch is just a huge screw you to tanky catch supports in bot lane.",1652546335

leagueoflegends,Scoreboard &gt; Progression,"Hey Community!

While adding new progression tracking to the end game screen may seem like ""it's more fun"", I'd really prefer to first see the end game scoreboard like it was before.

I get that this change is likely geared towards player retention (and perhaps more casual focused?), but for veteran players it's just an extra click to get to what I want to see.

Now, of course, no one speaks for everyone, and no change can make everyone happy... that is, unless you give people options. Here's what I'm suggesting:

1. Put Scoreboard first -- this will please most of the playerbase I'm willing to wager, but since I'm not sure, there's a better option.
2. Put an option in Settings. This may be somewhat obscure, but since we're PC gamers, having options in settings is always welcome. For a more ""intuitive and hands off"" solution, perhaps...
3. Have the end game screen default to the previous screen you left from.

Honestly, I'd really prefer options 1 or 2, since I always want score screen first.

leagueoflegends,Elaborate analysis on ARAM specific balancing and why it was a mistake,"TLDR: revert aram

After playing 2449 games in ARAM I think that I can make a post regarding the terrible state that aram is after the specific balancing. I wanted to start with the oracle changes, and how it is an'appropriate nerf to some champions (like teemo) and how it absolutely nullifies other champion spells (like nidalee){1 oracle every teemos in patch 7.13 &lt;- 9.0} . I started to look for statistical information to back up my thesis then I played a game against zed, irelia, nidalee and le blanc with sona in my team. Who in god's name thought that buffing some of the of the strongest assassin in the game was a good idea, how is ziggs completely gutted due to boring poke damage and nidalee {110%-&gt;Q 120%AP scaling + ludens- RIOT API sin()} buffed? I understand that healers in aram are boring and they often were a huge factor in winning in the past, but now having a sona in your team is like having a fat minion with 30hp heal every 10 seconds {Sona winrate in aram  48%-10% = 38% 48&lt;less than ryze winrate ranked}.

leagueoflegends,The real fair solution for the ping issue.,"First I want to pin point the main arguments surrounding the whole fiesta. And provide a hypothetical balanced solution to the problem. 

1. RNG had unfair advantage due to ping differences.

Sol: Replay those games.

2. The ping advantage altered teams‚Äô decision on champion picks. I.e gangplank

Sol: Replay all games with or without RNG. Because some players/teams are better with gangplank with actual 35 ms ping.

3. RNG had to play 3 more games compared to other teams can potentially lead to exposing secret strategies and gave their opponents more clips to study their game. 

Sol: Replay all games with or without RNG before the ping fix. 

4. RNG don‚Äôt have to travel to the stadium and other teams didn‚Äôt have to have their own coach/staff set up the client connection and overcome tech problems. 

Sol: have all RNG members sitting in a cardboard made car for 1 hour bonfire the game preparation period. Have all other team set up their client connection and overcome tech problems. 

5. The food.

Sol: All team must eat foreign food. For example, RNG, T1 must eat steak and smashed potato or spaghetti. G2 and EG must eat white rice/dumplings.

What else? What‚Äôs your opinion on this fair solution to the problem caused by Riot‚Äôs decision?",1652541837

If they were solo I guarantee they play normally and we just win the game. Now im not salty because I played really well and losses happen. HOWEVER I do see this way too often for it to be a coincidence.

leagueoflegends,Personal preference on what I'd like to see format wise at MSI,"Every year I get a bit bored of major regions smacking down wildcards in the group stage. I'd personally much prefer if major regions got automatic seeding into the knockout stages and the group stage was used to see which wildcard teams end up facing them.

I put together a proposed format that would give me everything I'd like to see. The group stage allows wildcards to battle it out amongst eachother rather than get smacked by major regions. Then the strongest wildcard from each group plays the weakest of the other group in a b05, with the winner of that moving on to face LPL or LCK in the quarterfinals.

The wildcard teams that finish 2nd in their group would face eachother in a b05 to see who moves on to play vs LEC in the quarterfinals.

LCS and PCS will play eachother in the quarterfinals as they are reasonably similar in skill and are generally (outside of MSI last year where PCS did really well) battling for 4th place.

From there on it's just best of 5s until the end.

What do you think of this format? What would you like to see? Would you change anything or do you like the way it is currently?

leagueoflegends,Official: Riot testing FPE (Fair Ping Environment) for North American server (parody),"Many of you may have noticed League's North American server had reconnecting/disconnecting issues a couple days ago.

Well, in a strange turn of events, Riot has announced the first iteration of **FPE**, otherwise known as Fair Ping Environment.

Due to the positive feedback Riot received a week ago from one random South Korean fan regarding the artificial 35 ping at MSI, they have decided to pursue a similar process for the entire North American server, to ensure fair ping for _everyone_ at the _same time_. No longer will games be unbalanced and based on who has the best connection and closest to the servers in Chicago.

That's right, from now on, everyone will experience the same ping for every game. It was difficult to understand how to best approach this method, so going with something similar to MSI was the easiest and safe bet.

Unfortunately, some accounts on NA play from countries far away, or have poor internet or systems to play on, so the average will be a bit off. You'll be looking at games up to 50000 ping or complete disconnects to balance out Timmy from Australia and many others like him, who play on a 2010 HP laptop on public plaza WiFi.

Best of luck summoners!",1652538026

There are many abilities that enhance basic attacks, I did some testing to see which of these abilities still work. The abilities that work and do not work are very inconsistent, either all the abilities in the results should work or only the basic attack part should be enhanced. 

I divided the spells in three categories

* Working - the full ability benefits from hullbreaker bonus damage, this includes basic attack part, bonus damage portion, and ability damage. E.g. 100 AD, bonus damage = 50 --&gt; 150 damage gets the hullbreaker bonus. Or an ability reading ""deals 200 damage"" --&gt; 200 damage gets hullbreaker bonus.

* Partly - only the basic attack part of the spell benefits from hullbreaker. E.g. 100 AD, bonus damage = 50 --&gt; 100 damage gets hullbreaker bonus

* Not working - Neither basic attack part bonus damage part benefits from hullbreaker. E.g. 100 AD, bonus damage = 50 --&gt; 0 damage gets hullbreaker bonus



Working
---------
* Fiora E (crit)
* Rengar Q (normal, enhanced)
* nasus Q (including stacks)
* Vi E
* Sett Q 
* Sett Passive
* Xin Q (all 3)
* Master Yi Passive


Partly
---------
* Jax W
* Xin Passive
* Shyvana Q (Normal form, First Q hit works, 2nd Q hit does not)

Not working
---------
* Trundle Q
* Camille Q (both)
* Darius W
* Wukong Q
* Mundo E 
* Garen Q
* Shyvana Q (Dragon Form)

leagueoflegends,The new challenges make me feel like the past 9 years account for nothing.....,"There are A LOT of challenges i have done over the many years i've been playing this game and i just don't have it in me to try and do them again just for the sake of having an icon i can flex....  


Yes these challenges may make people wanna come back and re do everything but i have been playing this game since season 3 and...well.... getting some of those challenges was ~~RARE~~ next to impossible, as in, it almost never happened, not just to me but in anyone in the match, all 10 of us. Things like doing a penta twice in the same game...or stealing ALL the epic monster in a single game...kill 3 barons in a game (this is unrealistic as fuck now with the average game lasting 25-30 mins....). All these did happen at some point over the course of 9 years but they were maybe once or twice....  


There is no sense of progress on them for people like me cause stuff you have already done are accounted for in the collection section (like hitting mastery 7 with a lot of the same class champions) or you are in a higher tier in some others but you already have your favorites and everything, as an adc main you can't have me get a mastery 7 on Azir/Kennen/Teemo/Jayce/Kindred just so i can get the grandmaster icon for marksmen. I cant be playing mid top and jungle when im only proficient as an adc...Same goes for other classes...i saw Jhin in the mage mastery challenge...how exactly does Jhin quilify to be in there? Because his traps are doing AP damage? Why isn't Lucian Tristana and MF there too then? I dont know if this was a mistake but it doesn't make much sense to me. But what do i know to challenge 200 years of gaming development knowledge right?  


Some may argue that THAT is the challenging part of the challenge but it just doesn't sit right with me...You cant ask from people that are proficient in one thing to start doing something else just to prove that they are proficient in the thing they were interested in the first place....Imagine wanting to be a hairdresser but having trigonometry in your courses and you wont be able to get your degree unless you get good at trigonometry....Does this make sense to you?  


I don't know, maybe im bitter cause this game was AWESOME from season 3 until season 5 and from then on it just kept getting worse over and over and mostly for my role that i had to endure all the bullshit the ""amazing developers"" at riot came up with...the critical reduction....the unkillable tanks meta...the double sunfires meta...the roaming support meta....the overall damage reduction on adc's patch by patch....the ""pick whatever the fuck spamming mage as support"" meta....the get blown up in under 1 second meta (which still is happening by either mages or assassins)...the adc items are so garbage now that its better to pick an adc that can use lethality items meta.....and so on....not a single other role has been affected so much by all the changes and yet all you heard was ""adc's are still too powerful"" just because the 200 pros at the top revolved their whole gameplay around the adc....No shit Sherlock...i wonder what would happen if they revolved their gameplay around the mid laner for a couple of seasons.....  


Even the new changes with the increased health will make matters worse....it already feels like i don't do any damage, imagine if i have to hit a target with more health now how it will feel....  


I think it's time to say goodbye to this game. The challenges are depressing and the overall game is just not fun anymore, when you win you are just happy you didn't lost not because you won. Besting your opponents was the pure joy of this game, and i'm not talking about the kids that go 15/4 and are happy that are squashing enemies cause it rarely happens for them, im talking about actually having an interesting match of the same skill level people where you actually getting challenged instead of getting erased in 1 second by an overfed enemy that came from another lane. These matches are 1 every 500 games....  


So, yea....i think this is farewell.",1652536757

I know there are ping issues and what not, but is that the only reason, we see this happening? Even as a LEC fan i am completely shocked how easy G2 is crusing through this stage, while they looked shacky all spring until their run started. The only team i thought would show this dominance was T1, but it seems like the major regions just pick up stomp after stomp to a point, were i feel bad for the wildcard teams.

400 Health

30 Armor

30 Magic Resist

10 Ability Haste

  


Passive - Gain damage reduction the lower your hp gets; from 60%hp = 10% damage reduction up to 40%hp = 30% damage reduction

  


Each legendary gives 10 Armor and Magic Resistance

leagueoflegends,[EUW] Who wants to join a discord for 5v5 customs for both high and low elo? (With scrims bot!),"Hey:) If you're looking to join a server for playing fun custom games with comms then join Crustacean Corner. The server was made under a week ago and already has well over 200 people in it, but the more people that join, the better the scrims will be and faster the queues will pop. There's also a bot which lets you decide your roles, queues you up and reports the result of the games which then decide the server leaderboard, which can be found here: [https://crustacean-corner.herokuapp.com/](https://crustacean-corner.herokuapp.com/)

There are three different tiers for matchmaking: Plat and below, Diamond+ and then a free-for-all universal section if you're not bothered about the ranks you're playing with/against. No toxicity (obviously), by far the main focus is fun and making friends but we obviously still want people that will try to win so it remains at least a little competitive, and presumably being able to communicate with all your teammates is great practise for those that are higher elo and looking to join an amateur team (or just looking to stomp some clash tournaments).

My IGN is: Baron Burglar

If you have any questions, feel free to add me on that or DM me from this post and I will answer any you may have. We also take suggestions on how we can improve our bot and make it more user-friendly so that everyone can benefit the most from it.

When I play with my brother (silver 1) we have about 10 second qu time but if I play alone (plat 4 but dont play much ranked) it usually last about 3-5 minutes EACH TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone sait there is some kind of ""hidden"" mmr thats specially for game-modes which might be messing with my qu timer.

I've also noticed that if I win games back to back then my qu time goes up. But when I lost 2 games (both with 3 minute qu time) then the next game estimated 20 second qu time. We won, and it's back at 3:30.

leagueoflegends,What to do against two splitpushers?,I just played against a trynadamere mud and a sion top. Literally nothing we could‚Äôve done.

And they had a fed sivir thanks to our 2/12 mf so we couldn‚Äôt split the party up efficiently because she was able to 1v2.,1652511628

leagueoflegends,My two cents about why League doesn't feel as when we started,"I always hear people saying ""Oh, the client is bad"", ""Relax guys, new Lux skin next month"" or whatever, and although it is actually true, it's far from why we (League veterans) can't see the game as we used to.   
Riot forgot that it's a game, that's it. It just became too serious, too fast.   
I remember League having many game modes to choose from (even before URF was a thing) and IF you wanted to test your level, you could face other people that were also at the ""max level"", after grinding the IP to buy the rune pages and begging to God to be at least 3rd on the champion pick phase. Nowadays every decision is based around ""how will this affect ranked/pros?"" way before ""will this make the game more fun?"". I understand that League has become an E-sport and all of that, but now it is just a sinkhole to old players that are too addicted to proving to themselves and to their friends that their rank is actually not that low.   
New players are NOT welcomed to join this game, not because it is complex as fuck, but because everyone acts like you can't make mistakes, like...""What do you mean you don't know exactly the most efficiently jungle path that some Korean dude calculated?? We're Gold 2 FFS, I'm AFK base"".  
Well, I may be a nobody, but in my humble opinion, League will never get better if Riot doesn't take a step back and try to remember how to make a game before worrying about how to make that .04 % of the player base feel less shitty about being killed too much.",1652509544

leagueoflegends,Promos and fear of them. Returning player.,"A little bit of context before I go to the point. I was playing league actively long ago. Season 3-4 I guess. Dropped it ever since. I mean I kept playing Arams, enjoyed TFT for a little while, played lots of LoR before the certain patch. League? Not so much.

Now to the point: I have returned this season. Not fully but I played some ranked queue. It is fun, got my first promotion after getting enough LP. Great. Kept playing. And then at the border of silver and gold I met them. The promos. And when I was younger they were giving me all kinds of anxiety. ""Oh, no. If I lose now I'll have to grind my wins all over again"". You know it. Must-win games. Puts additional pressure on you. But now? The only thing that I felt was disappointment. Strong disappointment. Strong enough to write here.

I mean I look at them and see something extremely redundant. You don't need them. There is no reason to have them in the game. If the player is much better then his current division he will go smoothly. If he is worse even if climes he will fall back or get stuck. But if he is somewhat better he'll have to rely on a team. And me? I don't care. Leave them, have them, whatever. But I remember the mental discomfort from years before and as an older man I can't understand why would you as a developer  make your player suffer through it. Again. And again. And again. What is the point? Because if there is none that is just unjustified cruelty towards a more addicted players. 

TLDR When I played league yeas ago I didn't notice how bad the whole design of promos was. Now I see it and am shocked that this atavism is still here.",1652506735

leagueoflegends,Lore Question: How does the Noxian Trifarix work?,"Hello, this is a lore question I have regarding Noxus and Swain. So after Swain murked Darkwill and took control of Noxus, he set up the Trifarix which is where three people together run and govern different aspects of Noxus. We know that these three are Swain, Darius, and LeBlanc (or at least a puppet for her), but I'm confused as to why Swain designed it this way. The reason he created the Trifarix in the first place was to diminish Leblanc's grasp of power over Noxus since she keeps controlling every leader into corruption. The logic is supposedly if one leader is corrupted, then the other two can step in and hold them back. But that's the problem: one of the leaders IS Leblanc, and Swain knows this, so we did he only appoint 3 branches? Wouldn't this design not work at all if Leblanc manages to corrupt either him or Darius since then it will be a 2v1?",1652506262

leagueoflegends,Saying others are tryhards is not an insult,"Simply because LoL is a game for tryhards

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Beside the fact it's tryhards/losers/toxics that that use this insult, let me explain :

&amp;#x200B;

1) CSing is tryharding. If someone is not tryhard, they would miss 1 or 2 minions on 3 possible they could do it. And/or spamming attacks+skills on minions

2) Lot of skills that need to aim like veigar cc, need to be a tryhard player or they are useless skills (\*cough\* me that don't bother aiming correctly when i used once veigar in aram)

3) If not tryharding, people won't bother looking at minimap vision

4) If they are not tryharding, why the f the enemy keep spamming skills like a madman ? Isn't it him the tryhard ? What about his teammates ?  
(an ahri in arurf in an example)

5) If some people watch YT channel of ""Vars"" or simply play LoL for a long time, they know lot of (new) champs are totally broken op.  If not tryharding, you basically can't win against a team having a op champ(s)

6) Saying others of being tryhard because they destroy the nexus and not letting the game go on more, is just a question of preference. It's the broad topic of ""likes/dislikes"" of human beings. Some players like the process, some people like the end result of the process. Also who dislike seeing the game say you win ?  
Beside a ARAM where it was a enjoyable game where everyone was playing wholesomely/teamwork or really interestingly in both camps, where even the global chat was wholesome/joking, i don't think there are other possibilities where a team let the other team win with a true 100% happy smile.

And it's also more because RIOT balancing is entirely s.................SUPERB  
Hehehe, it is SO ENJOYABLE fighting a pyke/GP with 2 items/viego

\-----------------

Anyway, people that are not tryhards are the ""noobs"" that quit because of community or the difficulty of the game, or they are plastic/wood ELO, or the ones that only do ""VS AI"" mode",1652504019

leagueoflegends,Does Riot's favoritism towards LPL decrease your interest in watching LoL esports?,"Here is a few of these instances:

- Allowed LPL media to cover Worlds last year while excluding all other journalists from other regions.

- Forced everyone to play on 35 ping so that it would be ""fair"" for RNG who could not make it to South Korea.

- Changed Damwon's match schedule during MSI 2021 resulting into an extra day for RNG.

I've been watching LoL esports since S3 but over the years as the LPL scene grew, the more Riot favoritism is showed by Riot to them. The tournaments doesn't carry the same prestige anymore since Riot's is compromising competitive integrity in order to maximize on the LPL scene.

leagueoflegends,league needs to reward players more for not being toxic.,"the honor system is complete trash. i've been honor 5 for the past 3 seasons. is it a good reflection of my honor? no. is it a trash system that needs to be redesigned with a greater incentive towards players? yes. do i deserve honor 5? short answer is no.

 the honor orbs and capsules you get give some useless champ shard, 4 key fragments, and an emote. you get these capsules once in a blue moon and the rewards are literally worse than a chest's. The honor 5 token IMO should be prestigious and something that yields good rewards. but the fact that for the past 2 seasons the token rewards have been medieval twitch and grey warwick is laughable.

 The funny thing is that i probably don't even deserve these rewards in the first place, i (like most league players) flame my teammates in chat. it's apart of the game. but I get honors 90% of the time for playing well, NOT for ""staying cool"" or ""great shotcalling"" it's a completely inaccurate representation of the whole system.

i just think that the whole premise of relying on ""honor"" to be able to open chests that YOU earned from playing well is incredibly stupid. as well as how riot tries to ""incentivize"" good behavior when people who are legitimately toxic and run it down don't even get a slap on the wrist for doing so.",1652502143

MR stacking is more efficient than armor stacking because AP characters rely on cooldowns to do damage instead of auto attacks.

leagueoflegends,Not nerfing true damage champs in 12.10 is the biggest blunder I've seen in a while,"I can't believe that the PBE doesn't include any nerfs to champs like Vayne, Fiora, Velkoz, Chogath, Garen.  Feel free to add any I missed, the point is that when you increase armor and MR across the board true damage becomes much more valuable.

What's more Vayne and Fiora are already strong/OP right now.  I don't get why we need 12.10 to be a complete free for all with riot failing to address obvious problems with their changes.

The 12.10 durability changes will likely make the game better overall and it's been badly needed for sometime.  But we have a chance here for a well balanced and fair patch, why not shoot for that instead of just letting these champs run amok like they are on the PBE right now.

Vayne is broken on the PBE for anyone who's bothered to try playing her.  She's extra tanky and harder to kill meanwhile her targets die just as easily as ever thanks to %maxHP true damage.  The counterplay to Vayne is killing her before she kills you, I know the balance team isn't filled with rocket scientists but how could they miss something so obvious.",1652500677
leagueoflegends,There shouldn't be any region with four teams in the World Championship.,"Let me list two reasons:

01- We can have quarterfinals with only Chinese and Korean teams.

That hasn't happened yet, but the potential for that to happen is growing every year. This year, Korea is likely to have 3 very strong teams with T1, Gen. G and Dawmon Kia. If another strong team shows up in the summer split, we'll probably have the four Korean teams in the Worlds playoffs. In Worlds 2021, for example, only it didn‚Äôt happen because FPX imploded and Group D tiebrakes didn‚Äôt let happen... It was pretty close.

A championship such as the Worlds has, in addition to the strength of the teams, the variety of regions which compete as attractive. I think that the vast majority of viewers do not want to see the same regions in all matches of playoffs.

02-  Great stories have been written by teams from minors regions

Kabum vs Alliance? INTZ vs EDG? Pain Gaming almost advancing to the playoffs in Worlds 2015? Albus Nox advancing to the playoffs at Worlds 2016? VCS teams and their different drafts?

Which victory was more memorable for Worlds history: Kabum vs Alliance or some LNG match last year? Until today the phrase ""this is for kabum"" is remembered.

I am Brazilian, I can tell you how much Kabum, Pain and INTZ participations meant to our region. Lives of players changed because of those matches. I can't imagine the hype that would have been if Pain Gaming had advanced to the playoffs in 2015. Maybe LoL would be even bigger than it is today in Brazil.

What should be done?

In my opinion, three teams from NA, EU, KR and CH should already enter the group stage of the Worlds (12 teams). Leaving the NA jokes aside, it makes no sense for these regions to play in the play-in stage.

It is hard to define the PCS, as they are a Worlds champion region, but recently only one team has managed to have a decent showing internationally, and that is PSG. I think it's fair that they have a direct spot for the group stage, but only that spot.

The play-in stage should be played by:

* Brazil - CBLoL
* Turkey - TCL
* Japan - LJL
* Oceania - LCO
* Latin America - LLA
* Vietnam - VCS\*
* Russia - LCL

\* Maybe Vietnam should also have a direct spot, but since they haven't played international competitions for two years, it's hard to know the real level of the region.

If Vietnam doesn't get a direct spot to the group stage, the play-in stage will give three spots to the Worlds group stage. If Vietnam have a direct sport at the group stage, the play-in stage will give two spot to the Worlds group stage.

The pools for the Worlds draw would be:

* Pool 1: NA, EU, KR and CH champions
* Pool 2: Runners up in EU, KR and CH. PCS Champion.
* Pool 3: Third places in EU, KR and CH. Second places in NA
* Pool 4: Third places in NA and all 3 wildcards.

Obviously, the positions of the regions in the pools should change according to the rankings of each region in the international tournaments. 

I think this way you could have a more interesting group stage, with potential groups of death with very difficult teams and groups of life where anyone can qualify. We would have more regions represented both in the group stage and even in the playoffs.

I know that many think that the Wildcards would become punching bags in the groups, but this is normal in almost every sport.  When one of these teams pulls off a surprise, a new huge story in the competition will be written. This is how regions develop.

This is what I think. I love the competitive LoL scene and would love to see more regions being represented in international competitions. It would help the game remain big in all parts of the planet.

While adding new progression tracking to the end game screen may seem like ""it's more fun"", I'd really prefer to first see the end game scoreboard like it was before.

I get that this change is likely geared towards player retention (and perhaps more casual focused?), but for veteran players it's just an extra click to get to what I want to see.

Now, of course, no one speaks for everyone, and no change can make everyone happy... that is, unless you give people options. Here's what I'm suggesting:

1. Put Scoreboard first -- this will please most of the playerbase I'm willing to wager, but since I'm not sure, there's a better option.
2. Put an option in Settings. This may be somewhat obscure, but since we're PC gamers, having options in settings is always welcome. For a more ""intuitive and hands off"" solution, perhaps...
3. Have the end game screen default to the previous screen you left from.

Honestly, I'd really prefer options 1 or 2, since I always want score screen first.",1652491322

leagueoflegends,Team Combinations for Challenges,"TL:DR There is a bunch of different teams that can hit 7 harmony categories for challenges. 

I haven't seen anyone do this yet, so I thought I would post.

For those of you who don't know, in the Teamwork and Strategy has a subcategory ""Harmony"", in which you progress by stacking a five man with 3+ from various categories. Ex. We Protec: Win with a 5-stack of 3+ champs with heals or shields. 

You don't have to guess what counts, if you go into challenges, it will show you the list of eligible champions. (What counts as a ""hook"" is bizarre to me)

The thing is, you can progress multiple categories in the same game if you overlap a few champions. For example, if you play Vayne, Pyke, Blitz, Teemo, and any fifth member, you will get ""Where'd They Go?"" with three stealth champions (Vayne, Pyke, Teemo), and ""Get Over Here"" with three hook champions (Pyke, Vayne, Blitz).  


So the question is, what five man team covers the most categories? People [have already been speculating](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/unwjx6/me_and_my_5_stack_completed_five_harmony/), but now I can tell you with the power of a few lines of python.

The most categories you can cover is seven, but you can accomplish that a bunch of different ways. Some of them are even viable as teams.

You'll notice a lot of them have Senna or Maokai, they are present in the most catgories (6 and 7 respectively).

I have a much longer list of all teams that fulfill more than five categories, DM me if you want it.

leagueoflegends,Wait a minute; is Time To Kill higher or lower in durability patch 12.10?,"Riot Axes said they are soon looking to increase TTK by ""pulling damage from the game and extending combat timewithin the next few weeks"". 

Did they reduce damage in 12.10 or only lower durability?
That would reduce TTK, wouldnt it?

______________________

Good job if Riot is raising TTK. 

Coming from Dota I observed that a higher TTK;

- Allows fights to unfold

- Minimizes luck factor

- Accentuates champ role (not everyone approaches assassin burst window)

- Highlights player skill with more chances for skill expression

With low TTK luck plays a big role on initiation and player reflexes, and conversely cuts back on allowing individual skill to rein in a fight or salvage a bad situation. All valid points when considering a healthy direction for the game.  


_______________


Normalizing high TTK and more safe disengages in fights would be healthy for viewership and combating 1-sided stomp games.

leagueoflegends,Question about Summoner Name decay,"So I decided that I want to change my summoner name, because I got tired of it after a while, and the name that I want to change it to is taken. As far as I am aware, there is a system for ""name decay"" in which an inactive account's ign will be available for someone else to claim after a certain period of time. The league support website says this is a base 6 months upon creation of the account, with added time per level above 6, with a max of 30. What I am curious about is does this 30 include the base 6 months? Or add on to it for a max of 36? Another thing I am wondering is if the account in question that has the name I want hasn't played a game since season 7, shouldn't enough time have passed by now regardless?",1652487778

Vayne and Kai sa are the ABSOLUTE worst adcs to lane with, even including some of the other bottom tier adcs, atleast theyre not miserable to lane with. This is universal though, good vaynes/kai sas and bad vayne/kai sas are all equally miserable to lane with and I think I can finally pinpoint it, the type of person that plays these champions bottom lane typically has delusions of grandeur thinking that them being zoned for 20 minutes wont matter because late game they will carry the last 2 minutes of the match, they want to carry, more than they want to win, and they will throw games left and right because of it.

leagueoflegends,ARURF is feeling a bit lacklustre.,"Hey guys just posting the biannual URF complaint post. Second day of ARURF and I'm pretty much already over it.

Inb4 the ""it's for fun"" comments, but I think that is where the problem lies: not very fun lots of the time. Other than the obvious cases of rolling a garbage champ selection and getting stomped in 10 mins or rolling melee champs into ranged and getting bullied into your fountain unless you build tank stats (soooooo fun /s), I noticed even rolling cheesy OP champs isn't fun due to how much of a stomp it usually is now.

Years ago you could build off-meta items on your champs and do surprisingly well on a lot of them. Sure you can still do this sometimes today (attack speed Braum), but most of the time you are just gonna grief yourself and your team. So tanks are left to build ""tank"" (again, soooo fun for you and the other team) and damage champs are left to build typical damage builds. Maybe it's due to regular SR having URF damage for the past couple seasons now that the gamemode has lost it's charm.

Strangely, anyone else notice how some URF staple champs are kinda lacklustre these days? I'm talking Karthus, Cass, even AP Malph isn't as fun/strong comparatively to everything now.

Also, are respawn timers usually this apparent in URF? I see nearly 1 minute respawn timers at 15 minutes, which causes games to end before lots of players even reach the power fantasy that URF is supposed to provide. This is especially noticeable since towers are solely cosmetic 10 mins in. I have seen many ""comebacks"" because players don't realize that their timers have gained 40 seconds in 5 minutes and thus lose the game after the first real team fight.

Ultimate spellbook has replaced URF as my favorite for fun gamemode. It gives you the interesting power fantasies without much of these frustrations. Please bring it back rito.

leagueoflegends,Can anyone explain what the counterplay to GP is supposed to be?,"This champion is legit just amazing at everything. He has a amazing early game laning, amazing sustain, great poke and you can't even cc him.

Okay so his early game is really strong, that's fine. At least he can't have global impact from level 6 forward without ever giving up anything in lane. Oh wait. 

Okay but since is laning is so strong and he has global impact he has to have weak waveclear right? Wait no he one-shots waves the whole game. 

Okay well then I'll just go even in farm with him and out scale him right? Well no since even if you are even on farm he gets 800 gold from first strike and another 1 k from his passive making him stronger than you all game if you go even in cs. 

Well at least he wont one-shot my whole team in the late game right? Wait shit, he can do that too.

I can leave the game so I wont have to deal with this fucking exodia champion at least so maybe we can consider that counter play.

leagueoflegends,The ‚ÄúLeave Penalty‚Äù Mystery,"Today was the day. It finally happened. I had to afk a game. I was half way through an ARURF and my plumber showed up (an hour early). I had to afk the game to show him where to park and showed him the issue in my apartment. 

When I came back, the game was over. Next to my name it said ‚Äúleaver penalty applied‚Äù. A wave of excitement came over me, finally I get to see exactly what happened to all of those 100‚Äôs of people that afk‚Äôd when I‚Äôve been in a game with them. 

So I went back to the lobby, waiting for my punishment for committing such atrocities. I get a pop up on my screen, saying don‚Äôt afk, it‚Äôs not good. Then I queued for another game, not even a dodge timer or anything. 

So, what was the leaver penalty? I‚Äôm actually disappointed. Nothing happened. I‚Äôve had multiple people afk in solo queue and in normals and I hate it.

leagueoflegends,"Have a Selected ""Anti-Autofill"" Role? (Solo Queue Role Selection Discussion)","# Autofill Rework/Adjustment Concept:

To elaborate, I was curious about the idea of potentially having a **THIRD** role that you can *""select""* as essentially a ""**DO NOT F\*\*\*ING PUT ME IN THIS ROLE""** role. I am fully aware the queue times in the higher ranks can get really ridiculous, however; I don't believe that it would be *that* detrimental to low and mid ranked players. So, you would essentially select your primary and secondary roles; but if Autofill is enabled, you would select **JUST ONE ROLE** that you strictly **DO NOT DESIRE TO PLAY!** Not sure about any of you guys, but I wouldn't mind if Solo/Duo queue times went up by maybe an extra 20-60 seconds if it would ensure that I never have to play *""that one role""* in which I tend to not perform as consistently in.

leagueoflegends,Tower Damage in URF/ARURF,"With ARUF making a brief return at the moment, I want to bring light to an issue (at least in my opinion) about URF. URF is THE for-fun game mode in League, so many people refuses to play anything else but URF. All due to the chaos element of the game mode.  
So having 1-2 players on the enemy/your team use their reduced cooldowns to end the game in 15 minutes, would suck the life energy out of anyone.   


That obviously sucks for people wanting a break from League's hyper-competitive nature. So here is a thought I had: Why not just reduce damage to structures?  
It would prolong games with a decent amount, ultimately resulting in players getting to get a better URF experience.

leagueoflegends,"NEW MSI Format giving more best of's, more games from the top regions and more competitive games from emerging regions"," So I believe this format would take around 2 extra days, but should make the tournament much more interesting. So have a group stage with 2 groups in a double round robin. 1st group would be pool 1 and pool 2 teams this would look like T1, RNG, G2,PSG, EG, SGB with 6 teams . Second group would be pools 3 and 4 which would be DFM, AZE, RED, IW, ORD. half of each group would play every day and games would switch between both groups so there would be implications for every region every other game. After this would be a pre rumble knockout stage bottom 3 of group one vs top 3 of group in a best of 3, 4 vs 3, 5 vs 2, and 6 vs 1. Then would be another  double round robin with teams that placed 1-3 in group one and the 3 winners of the Bof3's. This round robin will have all 6 seeds move on but seeds 1 and 2 get bye in the following best of 5's. 3 vs 6 and 4v5 while 1st seed gets choice of opponent in the following round and 2nd seed gets the other. This gives all the pools more meaningful games, it makes every seeding matter and luck of draw is irrelevant. More games of the best vs the best. adding maybe one more day for the first knockout (at most 9 games and can be played at smaller venue) and another day for the extra 2 seeds from rumble stage getting through.

leagueoflegends,My suggessted format for future MSI Rumble Stages,"[Swiss format rumble stage](https://imgur.com/a/cMDYw9L)  


\^This is my suggestion for what future MSI Rumble Stages should look like.  I think the current rumble format is extremely boring given that we have to watch teams like T1 and RNG absolutely roll over lower level opponents over and over and over.  I think its great to give lower tier teams a chance to play LCK/LPL teams, but at the same time it makes for some days that I don't even tune in to watch.    


My suggestion is to implement a system similar to how CSGO runs their majors.  The Swiss-Style bracket I think best balances fairness, quality of games, and entertainment value.  Sorry for my crappy MS Paint rendition of this suggestion, but for the two of you that see this I hope you're able to follow the drawing.

People that were planning on buying her with the ME from this pass, can no longer do so. This is weird. Can any riotors explain why she was removed after only 1 month, and before the pass?

Also, if you have it listed IN the shop that it will rotate on X day, you shouldn't remove skins and other items from the shop prior to that. It should change... when you say it will, ya know?

leagueoflegends,Any changes to true damage or %max hp damage for 12.10?,"Just wondering. We‚Äôve seen changes to healing across the board, reduces to healing reduction, and an increase to tankiness. Yet there are zero changes to true damage, or %max hp damage. I‚Äôve always thought that true damage was bad for the game, but if true damage remains as it is now, it will be detrimental to the game. These changes benefit every aspect of champions like Vayne. Not only do the tankiness changes significantly benefit those who have true damage, champions like Vayne and Fiora will actually be doing more damage than they currently are, in addition to being tankier. 

The only real counterplay to Vayne is to CC or one shot her, even then it is extremely hard when she has Shieldbow, Guardian Angel, Randuin‚Äôs, etc. Without that, she is going to be pretty much unstoppable. 

Discussing items, with the overall nerfs to all the anti-tank items, they are indirectly making all ADCs that aren‚Äôt inherently anti-tank worse, so this is a Kog‚ÄôMaw and Vayne buff. By the way, I‚Äôd just like to note that Vayne has been a borderline broken top-tier ADC all season, so I think a nerf is overdue anyway.

leagueoflegends,I don't think riot devs understand ehp,"A lot of players don't understand effective hit points. But the development team should understand it and start balancing around it. However every single patch it feels completely misunderstood or ignored. The first time I learned about EHP was in eve online when I started playing back in 2006 ish. They have this cool tool called EFT that keeps track of resistance, vamp ""lifesteal"", repair ""healing"", hull ""health, armor, and shield ""magic resist"". It shows you how much ehp you have and helps you decide what to sacrifice to increase damage without being an origami space ship. League doesn't really have this because lifesteal and vamp are too hard to put consistent numbers toward.

The point however is that I don't think riot even understands how this process works. Steraks for example adds far more ehp than any tank mythic as a legendary. Shields are a technical health buff without the downside of increasing max hp. And the regen makes it an insane value in team fights. But no one complains about steraks until a champ with a built in damage reduction or shield reset becomes damn near unkillable with it. Poppy, Warwick, irelia, jax, etc.

With the latest patch, I don't think riot understands what giving everyone essentially a tank mythic will do to the game. Not every champ is the same and an artillery mage isn't going to see the same performance out of a sunfire without a passive or affix as a Warwick or irelia. But you have to ask yourself, why are we blatantly aware of this issue and the devs are silent or apathetic to an obvious balance nightmare?",1652464780

Take a kill? He threatens to afk (Btw the kill could literally be yours like you did 90% of the damage and he will think he is entitled to flashing to last hit the kill then complain about how you wasted his flash)

1      Takes, literally, every kill as support but cries so hard when you take one from him. I'm talking about afking for 3 minutes then messaging me about how he won't afk actually because he doesn't want to get reported and banned. So he semi trolls after

He runs at mid, never comes to bot, and claims once I get 1 kill or 2 assists, I'm ""2v1"" so he never comes bot again. At times I literally beg him to come back but he just says ""haha seethe"" and he is diamond-master so he thinks everyone is worthless shit compared to him since I'm gold and we play in gold lobbies. He also lasts hits every kill as support and heavily always implies gold is useless on everyone but him because he's diamond and the lobbies are gold.

leagueoflegends,The durability patch will massively increase NA's chances of winning worlds,"I know what you're thinking - I've overdosed on a massive amount of copium right? Wrong. The durability patch is massively going to shake things up, and it's finally going to give NA a fighting chance at the trophy.

To understand why, we first have to understand why China and Korea have been dominant for so long. Now, a universally understood truth is ""you play the way you practice."" So where do pro players practice the most? Solo queue. So let's take a look at Korean solo queue.

I've spent dozens of hours researching Korean solo queue by watching NA's greatest 5 role challenger player, Tyler ""BIG TONKA T"" 1 destroy the Korean ladder. Once you've done as much research as me, you cannot escape the realization that Korean players are actually pretty terrible at league at everything but mechanics, which they get good at from low ping. They play fast paced fiesta games and snowball off kills. Once the durability patch hits however, champs will stop being one shotted, and mechanics will become far less important. This will allow NA to finally overcome Korea with their superior gameplay and macro knowledge - knowledge that players like the BIG TONKA himself have gained from the grueling NA ladder.

Now I hear your objections. First, what about China? Well it's known that the Chinese servers are even more fiesta heavy than the Korean servers, so they don't stand a chance. But what about EU? Well to be sure, they will benefit just as much as NA from the patch. However, that just means that the winner of worlds will either be EU or NA. Two options means each has a 50% chance. Which means NA has a 50% chance. And 50% of the time, NA will win every time.

If you can't get a kill while landing everything these champs and lanes become worthless.  What else do any of these lanes have going for them?  Removing kill lanes is bad for the game because without the all in kill threat these champs become worthless.

Riot needed to address certain outliers, like Rengars insane burst damage where he kills people in less than half a second.  Nerfing Rengars clear speed sure a nerf is a nerf, but his clear isn't why Rengar is an issue right now.  But instead of going after the problem champs riot decided to fk over the whole game and make some champs worthless instead.  I also think Vayne will be bonkers OP in patch 12.10 not nerfing Vaynes true damage while increasing tankiness.  Vayne has been really good all season and could use a preemptive nerf before she goes crazy in 12.10.

Then you have enchanters that are already very very strong right now, the only real counter to a champ like Lulu is to pick Blitz and just instakill the squishy Lulu. Then we have Senna who will benefit more than most from the armor increase because hers is so low to begin with.  Let's also consider Senna is already really strong if not OP right now she didn't need any help.

Melee supports in general need to have high kill threat otherwise ranged enchanters will just poke them out of lane for free.

12.10 is likely to be a mess because riot took the lazy route of increasing the durability of everything instead of looking at and adjusting champs causing the problems.  So now instead they'll have even more major problems they need to fix after.",1652464058

leagueoflegends,Why are there so many Chinese players on the NA server?,"This is not a hate post. This is a question post. 

I have noticed that since last season there has been a steadily increasing number of Chinese Players on the NA server. I was always wondering why they would choose to play with such high ping instead of playing on a domestic server. I can only speak to Plat-Diamond elo, but I would say there is a Chinese player in 30% of my games conservatively. To their credit they rarely type, ping, or communicate at all which could be a pro or con depending on how you view it.

You may ask, how do I know they are Chinese? And usually they have a Chinese name or the name of a Chinese pro player. Also, if you type anything in Chinese, they tend to reply. 

The other day, I finally got a small bit of insight into what was happening. After beating a Chinese player, I typed something to the effect of ""NA better than CN"" but in Chinese using Google Translate during the post game lobby. The player added me and told me to join his Discord. I joined and there were a lot of Chinese dudes in there. They flamed me for a bit (jokingly, i think) and after they realized I wasn't upset or angry. We talked a bit and I finally got to ask a Chinese player why there are so many of them on the NA server. 

He told me that they were University Students from China that are studying in the United States. I was surprised i hadn't considered this scenario, but to be honest, there seem to be too many Chinese Players for this to be the case. Additionally, I didn't see how that could explain the drastic increase in the number of them over the past year or so.

I am making this post hoping someone can give me factual insight as to what is happening. Is it really just University Students? Is it Chinese players choosing to play on high ping over their Domestic server? Is there some software that allows them to have reduced ping? 

Again, I'm just curious. To be completely honest, I don't mind them in my games especially since they usually play and never type or ping which is my preferred style of team mate. I am simply wondering what the explanation. 

Hopefully someone can provide that explanation before this post undoubtedly gets locked, removed, or I get penalized for asking an honest question.",1652463107

Yet for some reason, because I didn't lay out all the groundwork for every single corner case and ""what if"" scenario, as well as fully coded and implemented ideas on my own client, my idea is bad because it takes work or isn't 100% water tight. 

News flash guys, Nothing is 100%! By giving up at the *slightest sign* of *something* that *might* possibly go wrong, you're letting the trolls win. **It is not my job to propose changes to improve the game**. Riot is paid billions of dollars a year to create experience **WE** enjoy. Yes, making even the smallest change takes work. Riot pays thousands of employees to **WORK**. They have whole divisions dedicated to toxicity and player behavior. It's their job to make the game better, yet we hardly ever see any changes. 

I make posts because I really want to improve the game. I do it because I am tired of seeing people openly admitting to using alts just to be toxic while their main is untouched. I do it because the afk detection isn't even a working prototype, it's nonexistent. I do it because 35% win rate players shouldn't be in Master tier games. Ranked is all about competitive integrity, of which I can't find any.

The game isn't perfect, but any time an idea is pitched it's shot down by Joe Blow because sometimes his cat turns of his PC during a ranked game and he doesn't want to get punished. It's ridiculous. Can we just hold the people/teams responsible for these issues accountable? Can we just expect SOMETHING in the ways of progress?",1652462327
leagueoflegends,Just got banned from the discord server... Im wondering which moderator is an animal... Contact me asap.,"So as the title says.

I was using the official league discord for months or even years. A few minutes ago just noticed that it disappeared from my server list and im unable to rejoin so i guess i got banned. I didnt receive any kind of warning from the yuumi bot for trespassing the rules or whatever. And i didnt trespass any rules, im 100% sure of that. Im using 2 channels basically, the clip channel to share my twitch stream, and the lfg channel.

&amp;#x200B;

My last post was just :""lfd, gold, streaming, lf support"" on the lfg channel... Im wondering if anyone could point out what is the bannable offense here. Of course you cant.

So to the moderator who banned, be a man and contect me. Lets have a nice personal talk :)

I never ever flamed or was vulgar on this server, but im obviously now im pissed of coz this is outrageous.

&amp;#x200B;

Im looking forward to the staff to read this and reply to this. Also if someone can send me the discord tag of one of the moderators, go ahead pls, i want to contact them. Cheers",1652462291

leagueoflegends,If RIOT is going to let teams replay replay their games against RNG how come they won't let me replay my soloqueue games?,"I am an honest, hard-working auto-fill Morgana main. I don't flame, grief, or troll. When I signed up for this game, I agreed to the summoner's code. That's a contract. And it goes both ways. When I load onto summoner's rift, I expect a certain amount of fairness and parity in my games.

So color me pissed off when I finally get into a promo series for Silver, and I'm supporting against a Nautilus named ""The Hookening."" And I think everything is going super well. I'm auto attacking nautilus to assert my dominance (I watched a CoreJJ video about it once), and I see an opening to throw out a binding. But the game glitches somehow and it misses. I'm running away, and nautilus uses his hook, and somehow it still hits me even though I'm like half a screen away. From there it was all downhill. Hook after impossible hook yeeted me again and again to the fountain, and it was the fasted ff15 of my life.

I was really frustrated about this game, and then I saw that RIOT decided to replay all RNG games at MSI because the other teams were playing on higher ping. But then I realized that I TOO AM PLAYING ON HIGH PING. I choked out a disbelieving laugh as the clouds parted and white hot beams of understanding blasted into my beefy skull. That's it. That 0/13/2 Morgana game wasn't my fault. It was a ping diff.

So I giddily hopped back onto the client, and looked for a button that would let me replay my game on lower ping. But I still haven't found it yet. I've reported a bug since the ""replay game"" feature appears to be missing. But it's been about 45 minutes, and they still haven't fixed it yet. Is this normal?",1652455759

But it seems a bit odd for it to happen three in a row with different players. Not to mention the fact that each match was not only civil but also ones where I carried. So there wasn't any negative going on from either side.

leagueoflegends,"Shadowflame is lame as an Anti-Shield item and I have a couple ideas to make it actually anti-shield and not just ""the second flat pen item""","Shadowflame is actually just an item for AP champs to buy versus squishies. While serpent Fang scales against resists by effectively dealing (remaining shield at early expiration) true damage to affected targets, shadowflame is actually just not useful versus bulky shield users. Sion, Poppy, you get the picture. Both of these champions effectively take thousands of true damage over the course of a game from serpents fang though.  


How to help:  


**Without making it a proper tank buster:**

Shadowflame passive takes a percentage of the users damage on a shielded target and applies it directly to their health, thus penetrating the shield. That percentage could be equal to the flat magic penetration of the user (less effective versus tanks but still great for assassin users).  


**Making it mildly tank busty:**  
Shadowflame passive causes the user to deal increased magic damage to shielded enemies. That increase could be equal to the users flat magic penetration or percentage magic penetration, whichever is greater.

&amp;#x200B;

**Just use what works AKA literally make it AP serpents fang (fairly tank busty)**

 **UNIQUE ‚Äì** [**SHIELD REAVER**](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Named_item_effect#Shield_Reaver)**:** Dealing damage to an enemy champion injects them with shadowfire for 3 seconds, reducing any [shields](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Shield) they gain within the duration by (melee 50% / ranged 35%), and if the target was not already afflicted by the shadowfire, reducing all of their active shields by the same amount.

OMG people are gonna be toxic to me...SIMPLE solution take .5 seconds to click on the mute button , done enjoy the game. Its very annoying that the reason i cant communicate with my team is because of above which is solved by a simple click of a button. Voice chat has been in game like counterstrike for almost 20 years and per my experience 95% of people use it for teamwork and are nice to each other even when losing, the annoying people get muted and who cares. I think we can all agree that league is 1000 times more toxic than counterstrike for those of us that have played both games and one simple answer is because of not being able to properly communicate with your team in LOL.

Ok so why is it frustrating to play league with no voice chat... well people will start fights when you dont have ult or dont dont have mana or maybe your are sitting on too much gold and need to b. Also so many times i am split pushing and the only thing team needs to do is defend / fight under tower and i wish i could tell them that but no they will engage and then blame me for not being there and in this situation both parties are frustrated and it results in loss. Its hard to keep track of all the mana all the ults all the pings constantly. I play a lot of shyvana and i cant tell you how many team fights ive lost becasue people will engage when i dont have dragon form and the fight is lost (it also doesnt help that shyvana ult marker is bugged and always shows that i have ult even when i dont have 100% fury).

Also as a jungler id love to be able to tell top for example dont fight ill be there in 10 seconds after i get my blue and hit 6 but oftent times i plan on doing that only for top to die before i can get to him. Same thing with ganks as a jungler i have a very good idea where the other jungler is and its extremely annoying knowing where the gank is about to happen and seeing it happen few seconds later and my teamate dying despite me pinging back. I think we all have seen that often times pinging does not help for two reasons one people ping too much because its the only way to communicate so most people have learned to ignore it and two people are so focused on csing and trading that they will often not even notice the pinging.

Finally being able to talk strategy would be nice telling your team hey there is no way we ever win teamfights vs their twam comp we have to split push or try to get picks or lets go stand in this bush as 5 and try to catch someone... game would be much better if you could do this strategize like this but instead game is literally all about if 5 random people can learn to play as a team wihtout being able to communicate. 

Finally i will say that few years ago i was tryharding and inviting people into discord every game for about 500-600 matches and during all those games i only had to kick/ban one guy that started being toxic. Even when we  would end up losing everyone was generally nicer in voice chat saying gg we tried gl next game or damn mb i got rekt and leave nobody ever trash talked each other after game like they do in chat. I honestly feel that people behave way worse when typing then when they actually have to talk to each other using voice chat.",1652450903
leagueoflegends,Wildcard teams played more games under the old Wildcard qualifier tournament and teams were more stronger and battle-tested than now.,"The last time we've had [International Wildcard Qualifiers](https://liquipedia.net/leagueoflegends/International_Wildcard_Qualifier/2016) was at 2016 Worlds. Ever since the play-ins were introduced, not a single wildcard regions were able to make it out of the groups and played significantly less games at Worlds &amp; MSI. 

Before the wildcard teams ended up facing everybody and the best of the best made it through. Nowadays at play-ins, teams just play handful of Bo1s before getting going home and not really getting the international competition experience to help them take their skills to the next level.

It's disappointing because you followed the storylines of how teams like Albus Nox Luna beat compete against NA &amp; EU teams to make it to the playoff stage. I doubt we'll ever see a storyline like that because teams just dont have the opportunity to play enough games. The qualifier tournament was the best form of proving grounds for wildcard teams to legitimately earn praise through competition.",1652450053

leagueoflegends,There is nothing interesting about how League plays anymore,"Seriously these past two seasons have pretty much killed anything interesting about League gameplay and pushed it all towards the same ""instant nuke"", high damage, boring, gameplay. The buffs to GP are just the most recent. He was doing fine in top at most levels of play, then they buffed his Q so it could be spammed more, now they're buffing him more? It's not like his barrels are that hard to use, but sure, give me a 1300 damage nuke with three items that also procs collector, that's good game design.

There's so many absurd damage champions that the game isn't even fun. Things like the ""Shyvana over a wall for 1500 damage in under 1 second"" while also have 3500 health. Just... why? And best of all, you can't really counter these things very well. Because if you build defensive items, half the time you don't have enough damage to kill them. 

League used to be a game with a lot of variety to it, options, different ways to play, now everything has been shoe-horned into one boring to play meta. There's 110+ champions but for most players you see maybe 30 of them. I understand at pro play there's more diversity in picks, but at mid ELO, it's the same host of 30 picks every game.

leagueoflegends,Hear me out: the durability patch will give NA at least a 50% chance of winning worlds.,"Now I know what you're thinking - I've overdosed on a massive amount of copium right? Wrong.  The durability patch is massively going to shake things up, and it's finally going to give NA a fighting chance at the trophy.

To understand why, we first have to understand why China and Korea have been dominant for so long. Now, a universally understood truth is ""you play the way you practice."" So where do pro players practice the most? Solo queue. So let's take a look at Korean solo queue.

I've spent dozens of hours researching Korean solo queue: watching NA's greatest 5 role challenger player, Tyler ""BIG TONKA T"" 1 destroy the Korean ladder. Once you've done as much research as me, you cannot escape the realization that I (and Tyler) had: Korean players are actually pretty terrible at league at everything but mechanics, which they get good at from low ping. They play fast paced fiesta games and snowball off kills. This is the reason they've been so dominant over NA. Once the durability patch hits, champs will stop being one shotted, and mechanics will become less important. This will allow NA to finally overcome Korea with their superior gameplay and macro knowledge - knowledge that players like the BIG TONKA himself have gained from the grueling NA ladder.

Now I hear your objections. First, what about China? Well it's known that the Chinese servers are even more fiesta heavy than the Korean servers, so they don't stand a chance. But what about EU? Well to be sure, they will benefit just as much as NA from the patch. However, that just means that the winner of worlds will either be EU or NA. Two options means each has a 50% chance. Which means NA has a 50% chance.

TLDR: TSM's bringing it home.",1652446414

leagueoflegends,Why soloq feels extremely coinflip in low elo?,"
Well, first of all, I started playing league a year ago, in season 11, and since that I improved a lot as a player, I started playing ranked and demoted to iron 2, and I ended the last season in silver. This season, I created a new fresh acc to find out my true mmr and rank, and I learned a new role (was main adc, and started to play jg), I found a nice champion pool, I learned a lot about the game and about how to jungle in soloq, and in my new acc I started in silver 2 after placements with gold 3 mmr or something like that. I love the jungle role because I felt I improved a lot as a player, I have a lot of impact in the game and I achieve better climbing than playing ADC, but the other side of the coin is that spamming games a jungler is much harder than adc, the role is more demanding and is more tilting since you got all your team saying you how to play, when to gank, when to go herald or Drake, when they aren‚Äôt even able to set up a gank.

Well, after this brief introduction, this are the main reasons why I continue playing ADC in my main acc to climb in soloq, and to spam games, since in my main acc my mmr was pretty bad because I demoted to iron 2 when I started playing soloq last season, therefore, I was not really worried about climbing immediately, but after a couple of weeks tryharding, I‚Äôm done with it. Firstly, this might be related with the role I‚Äôm playing now -ADC- but the games feel coinflip as hell. Imo, I‚Äôm better at ADC than at JG because mechanically I‚Äôm pretty solid at ADC, but somehow, I achieved better results in terms of climb, win rate and score playing jungle. But at the same time, I feel that this is not only related with the role itself, the real issue involved is the whole soloq mmr system, and it‚Äôs pretty simple to summarize it: I feel that my games are not about the best player wins, but the team that got the worst player of the lobby loses. On my last 20 games, in 17 of them I have won or lost depending on a troll that played for my or either the enemy team. I won games with 6.5 cs, an average score and an average dmg, and then I lost games with more than 8 cs, 10 KDA scores and being top dmg of the game, and is not entirely because ""ADC can‚Äôt 1v9"", the truth is that any role can‚Äôt nowadays, because soloq in low elo feels coinflip as hell.

A few examples, in one game I was hard losing my lane and playing poorly but the enemy top laner decided to rage quit when he was 0-6, so we won, and today, I lost two games in which I was hard carrying, one of them because my jungle was soft inting because he was tilted with my mid laner, and the other one because my top laner ended 1-15-2 and basically afk farm in top side, stealing jungle camps to our jungler and recalling, doing this perma the whole game until we surrender. This happens every single time, there is at least one troll that will decide who wins and who loses the game, and if you are not smurfing or you have a huge skill difference over the other players (which is the same than being Smurfing at the end), you have no impact, you will win or lose depending on the matchmaking coinflip system.

I want to know your opinion about this, and your experience playing soloq in low elo (silver) because it really feels you have no impact in your games, and they are basically random luck games.",1652442235
leagueoflegends,What was the point of reverting Death's Dance and reworking Sterak's?,"Some time has passed [12.3] and I still don't understand why this change went through. 

Riot states:

&gt;Our approach to fighter Legendaries is similar: Shift health into AD across select items. Another top priority is to move Sterak's Gage out of being a go-to default option for all fighters. Lighter fighters should now be more intrigued by this reworked Death's Dance, which will scale with your other AD purchases and sustain tools. It also requires fighters to be constantly active in a fight to be effective, which is something we believe is important for systemic lighter fighter survivability.

Okay, so the change was intended to add more variety for different types of fighters and shift everyone away from the standard 3rd item Sterak's rush. They also wanted to incentivize 'more activity' among fighters (even though old Sterak's already did this). 

What ended up happening?

Death's Dance is now practically mandatory for 95% of melee AD users. Literally every single champion that built old Sterak's just replaced it with Death's Dance. Every single AD jungler rushes this 2nd, and every single AD top laner rushes this 3rd. Except now you also have champions like Talon and Kha'zix (who this item is completely unintended for) also rushing it 3rd and snowballing even harder because this item does not accomplish what it's intended for. Show up, take a bunch of burst, 1-shot and run away. You just mitigated 33% of all the damage you took while healing on top of that! How does this playstyle encourage any sort of prolonged fighting as opposed to the Old Sterak's (where you still had to fight to get Bloodlust stacks)? 

Not to mention, the effect is genuinely shit to play against. Old Sterak's had a shield (countered by Serpent's Fang) that also had a CD (pop it, back off, re-engage). Death's Dance's passive has legitimately 0 counterplay other than dealing true damage (which few champions have access to) and... not dying? It becomes even more toxic against snowballing leads in the mid-game, where you might simply lack the raw damage needed to burst whoever has it down before they can get a takedown and heal back up. 

I don't see how this change has benefitted fighters at all, and would love to hear some input because even as someone playing champions that frequently build it and the old Sterak's, I don't understand what this change has accomplished.",1652442161

leagueoflegends,As a chinses I want to talk about the real reason for the anger of LPL fans,"I'am a chinese.I want to talk about what happened today.

I am not a native English speaker, so please excuse me.

Some Western fans believe that LPL fans are angry because of nationalistic feelings, which is not entirely true.The real reason for the anger of LPL fans is distrust of  Roit Korea.

As you know, the nationalistic sentiments of South Koreans can make them do anything, most famously is cheating in the **2002 World Cup**  holds by KoreaÔºÜJapan.I believe anyone who watches soccer ball knows how dirty that World Cup was.

Back on Msi.  Why would this not be a problem at the time of 2020MCSÔºüThe focus is not AlexFran√ßois  find the mistake about ""ping"" ,but  **Who** caused this mistake.  This excuse can be artificially created.The organizer is a Korean employee.What if the mistake was made secretly by a Korean employee?

I  I really like Faker.I  watched Faker get his first worldchampionship title on live.And bought his championship skin of Zed in 2014.Now T1 is strong, it is a popular candidate for the champion title, there may be Korean employees who want to make sure T1 will win the 3rd MSI title.They can use this excuse to avoid any negative outcome for T1.Whether it's G2 or RNG.ÔºàSry to EG Ôºâ

Now could you understand the reason for the anger of LPL fans?

I am grateful for AlexFran√ßois found the problem before  T1 lost game.

leagueoflegends,People should ping more,"People genuinely don't ping at all (euw/eune) I don't know why. If people, whenever something relevant that requires any decision to be made, would just ping it, teams would be way more organized. If you're chasing an enemy with a friend and decide to turn away, ping your friend.

I'm p1 and watch map fairly often, I'd say once every 5s MAX, but I still sometimes make stupid plays because I expect something to happen off-screen which doesn't.

If I'm chasing an enemy and know that my friend is going to walk to them, that might enable a kill. If that friend then doesn't see it and turns away without pinging I might have just checked the map and now be focused on the animations of the enemy we're following, going too far alone and ending up dead.

It's pointless to argue whose fault a situation like that is, regardless of who is more to blame obviously both parties could've prevented it. And I think pinging careful the moment you turn away is great as if nothing else it'll then make me check map and check what your next move is  


I try to ping as much as physically possible, what I want, what I'll do, where I'll go, who I'm looking at (I just use the area is warded ping as it has an eye lol) if I see their mid going top I always ping it in the map etc.",1652438650

leagueoflegends,Progress in harmony challenges,"Do You and Your group love playing wacky comps and want to have a little gratification for it, something to commemorate that one night when You decided to bring out your 5 hooks team? Because I sure do, for me coming up with crazy and unique teamcomps with my 5-stack were some of the best games I have ever played. Hell, I suppose that is what challenges should be all about. And I still think that harmony group of challenges are easily the best of them all, for the wholesome ability to bring players together.

But they can be better.

My proposition is simple - change progress on those challenges from ""win X games with team of 3 or more champions with Y"" to ""win game with team of X or more champions with Y"" (so the first challenge is like one right now, then win with 4 of this quirk champs, then all of them). 

Think about it. Winning with team with 4 or 5 of one kink can be a exhilarating, hard and creative. Building a team with 3 of one gimmick is, if anything, a nuisance. There are guys who try to construct team to get as many of those 3 of Y-thing challenges at once, and good for You, in your 5-stack do whatever You want to have fun, but it's not what I look for. I look for characteristic and unique, but at the same time... well, challenging ways to play League with friends. 

Winning X matches with a mildly harder team of 3 of one quirk gets boring fast, but one win can be a good starter to more advanced challenges of that category. Conversely, getting achievement of 1 really hard-fought win is a greatest accomplishment one can give.

I thank You Riot for recognising us, seeing those harmony challenges brings me so much joy. But now that You did, I hope that You could expand on that idea. If You REALLY want to keep the grind on those challenges, just make ""win X games with team of 5 or more champions with Y"" after mission for singular win with team of 3, 4, 5 - it won't detract from their value, and if some group really wants to push them, they can.

TL:DR - Shift focus in Harmony challenges from winning more games with 3-of-a-kind team, to winning with increasing number of gimmicky champion in team at once.",1652436262

leagueoflegends,How would improve the MSI format?,"I think most people can agree that MSI this year has been pretty boring to watch so far. Most teams are pretty much locked in to the rumble stage by the end of the first half of group stage games. We're left with wildcard regions fighting over 2 place in two of the groups, who likely will proceed to get stomped in the rumble stage anyway.

The majority of group stage matches are nowhere near competitive. It's fun to watch your favourite team stop a wildcard team once or twice, but it gets super boring after that.

Personally I'd prefer a group stage that saw the second seeds of the 4 major regions competing with the wildcard regions, with the 4 first seeds getting a pass to the next stage but perhaps still having to fight it out for their seeding. 

What would you guys do to improve the MSI format?",1652434443

leagueoflegends,[Translation] Chinese fans' reaction of RNG rematch,"‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Due to the current heated  situation, the following comments may contain inappropriate language and offensive usage of vocabularies. 

1. No wonder the players in Busan said it didn't feel like 35 ping. It took you 3 days to find out the ping difference among teams.

 2. Classic indie company Riot,  classic someone else has to  pay the price for your mistake 

 3. I'd have quit if I were them(RNG), let's see who's gonna bite the bullet 

4. Foking* ridiculous, don't host the MSI if you can't.

5. So why didn't they check it on the first day when the players mentioned it, they just had to drag it to the third day after all the matches were done? 

6. So basically RNG has to wipe the floor with those teams again?

7. RNG had a stable 35 ping and the teams on stage have an unstable ping, did Riot eat feces?

8. Whatever, can we just quit? You begged us to play and still complain this, complain that.  Who cares about MSI? It's worthless even if you won the cham pion compare to the world.

9. Just wipe the floor with those teams again then quit.  Take it as training matches.

10. I see. It's not the internet was lagging, it's actually Riot's brain was lagging.

11. Prediction: there will be package losing in the game RNG vs IW, and there will be another rematch for ""fairness"".

12. eSports don't deserve to be in the Asian Game and LOL doesn't deserve to be called eSport. 

13. Been an EDG fan for 7 years and I have never wanted RNG to crush them this much. (Similar to real madrid vs barcelona)

14. Let's just forfeit worlds this year too, fking trash organization

leagueoflegends,LOL and Spotify Music Survey for Master Thesis,"**Q:** What kind of personality could be a **Shaco player** while listening to **metal music** ? :)

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone

I am currently working on my master thesis on the topic of **Spotify music and LOL Gamer's personality**. I want to collect data on usage behavior and if/how people play games with a different kinds of music on Spotify. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Would be much appreciated if some of you guys could participate in this since I need as many participants as possible. It should take no more than 3-4 mins and is mostly just checking little boxes, no typing required.

leagueoflegends,"My ping is different every game, how to fix it?","I have hardwired 1gb connection and I live in Vancouver, BC.  


In some games I get a stable 54ms, which is the best I can ask for in the west coast, but in some games I get a stable 63ms. 

I don't think it has something to do with my poor network connection, because they are always stable and ping don't spike at all, just the set ping from beginning to end is whether 63ms or 54ms.  


Did anyone have a similar issue and solved it? Any advice would be very appreciated.",1652429391

Did they change the system so you cant reroll mythic skins anymore?

leagueoflegends,Is Riot planning to do something about the trollers and toxic players?,"Okay first of all, this is NOT a rant post.

So today I've heard that at some point, Riot used to have human admins that were checking the reports. Players didn't get chat bans when responding to troll or even if you trolled back the person who started trolling you first. If this rumor is not true, I am sorry for spreading it, but as the idea, isn't it totally great?

All these cosmetics like masteries, ethernals, challenges etc are awesome. I really like them and it feels more like a big game that League is. Also I'm proud of Riot that they are doing this damage reduction patch. Finally a drastic change we all asked for. But is that what league player base values the most?

We all know players complain about lot of stuff: balance of the game, bugs and glitches, laggy client, lack of skins on some champions, but for most players, I think the most valuable experience are the PLAYERS THEMSELVES.

Lot of people are playing with the (team) chat turned off, but you shouldn't recommend people to this for 2 big reasons.

1. League of Legends is team-based strategy game, where your tactics have to change every game, additionally, you are usually playing with different people every game, so usually to have something more than just pings is essential

2. Telling someone to disable chat doesn't solve the problem, it only puts big band-aid on top of it. Additionally, maybe it will help you play better, but turning off your chat won't help your teammates to focus, unfortunately.

I know this is a hard problem, and am not blaming riot for not fixing it, but I think most of us would finally want to see to Riot at least start trying to something about it.

- maybe Riot can create new special kind of queue with only players that are frequently reported for toxic behaviours

- or what if players had some kind of ""warning"" on their profiles that they are toxic? Something like the new titles

- what about in-game report button? If enough players would report someone and a message would pop out that would warn them that players find their behavior toxic, similar when you are afk and afk warning pops out

These are only few of many possibilities that may help with toxicity. Some options are easier, some harder, some cheaper, some more expensive.

At the end, I want to clarify, I know having lots of deaths isn't a reportable reason, and it shouldn't be. What I was talking about was a legitimate greifing like refusing to play your position, taking smite and stealing your junglers buff etc.

Thank you for reading my post and please consider telling me your opinions on this.",1652428759

leagueoflegends,Concerning trend in MSI Ruling,"First of all, I‚Äôd like to start this by recognizing riot did the right thing by replaying the games that they find to be affected against RNG. 

However, I find the argument that the ping affected the other games evenly because they both dealt with the ping issues. The random ping spikes could have negatively affected one team more than another in impactful moments. With the knowledge that the ping was a large issue, did riot go far enough?  It‚Äôs unlikely that they would ever replay the whole tournament, but this wasn‚Äôt an unforeseen issue. This entire Reddit was up in arms when it was announced, even despite the double standard.

leagueoflegends,I think mage buffs should follow the durability update,"I have been playing since S2 so I have seen Riot hate mages for the better part of a decade. I feel like the durability update should allow for some buffs to make the role still feel good and not devolve into an ADC dictated meta. In the dev blog Riot said they still want burst mages to be able to 100 to 0 if significantly far ahead, so there is precedent for keeping some damage tuning in the game despite a durability buff to all champions. I think about champions like Annie, who has never been allowed to be a staple pick for any significant amount of time when Riot wants to keep other midlaners like Ahri, Ori, TF, Sylas, Ryze (pro) in high pick/ban. I think the base durability changes allow for something like +.05AP to her Q W and R to keep Annie from being unplayable and maybe find a chance to be pickable. Since there is more durability in the botlane ap scaling buffs should make her not take over as a support and catch up to other mages that have been outperforming her for years. I think Annie is the best example to show what champions are probably safe to buff with the update, I understand why Riot has been against flat ratio and damage buffs and try to do fancy utility tuning but if every champion is getting flat durability there should be consideration for giving like 25% of that back as damage for some mages.",1652426572

Pro players in LPL talked about how they will accept to not participate in MSI this year. It's not like Chinese care so much about MSI when we got 3 out of the last 4 worlds titles plus last year's MSI title. MSI doesn't mean sht compared to worlds. Instead, Riot let RNG participate remotely because MSI will be sht on multiple perspective such as viewership and competitiveness; MSI will never be the same without LPL. FYI LPL has the most MSI titles. It is not Chinese who came up with this 35ms sht idea, its fking Riot who proposed this and there's no reason why LPL won't take this proposal. After the announcement, a huge part of the community is fking flaming Chinese for this. Now things are becoming such a joke with all the rematch dramas, its funny how people are so stupid to attack each other instead of accusing Riot for this.

I translated it roughly. Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger!

‚ÄúSince the start of MSI, everyone in the team has been actively cooperating with all of the MSI standard technical tests and requirements. The team leader gets up at 8am. every day to cooperate with the test. This time, we can only ""cooperate."" Our fans can only ""cooperate"" by watching three more games. Of course, we will cooperate with the follow-up, and any other requirements they ask of us. The reason why we cooperate fully is because the result is worthy of the hard work and efforts of the players and staff. They are all worth it, nothing else.

There is no special advantage gained when the players have to wake up for a few hours to take the PCR test every day and have no time to do ranks before the game. The only ""advantage"" may be that the players have to get up at 9am every morning for the test, and going to bed and waking up early is good for their health.‚Äù",1652426067

leagueoflegends,MSI 2022 Event Tracker Spreadsheet,"# Disclaimer:

**This spreadsheet is heavily inspired by the previous sheets that** u/Shnow **made before. I designed this spreadsheet to be as close to the original as possible while changing it a bit to my personal taste and to make it easier to reuse in future events. Credit for** u/Shnow **for making the previous spreadsheets \^\^             (**This is my first ""real"" spreadsheet I ever created)

&amp;#x200B;

It's that time of the month again where we get a new event, but no real spreadsheet like we had before with Lunar Event and the events before.

**This spreadsheet will help you to keep track of all the tokens you have earned, your quests and how many you need to grind for unlocking the Mythic Essence or Talon Prestige Skin (Example).**

[Click File --&gt; Make a copy. Do not request to edit the document.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1axzQjHoBZGym10mKCud0doQ7mdUhSVxS/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=111043071267987123744&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)

&amp;#x200B;

**PLEASE REMEMBER to read the ""Read Me"" if you aren't familiar with the spreadsheets from** u/Shnow 

**After** [**making a copy**](https://puu.sh/HUT5A/f4262e671a.png) **for yourself. The 2. thing you should do is to go to the Wishlist tab and select all the items you want to purchase. Simply click the dropdown menu and select ""I want this"" (Mythic Essence and Prestige skin are active by default).**

 *Please make sure you follow the instructions for copying and do not request edit access.* 

All numbers are dynamic and will adjust as you gain tokens. They will also adjust for each day automatically, so no matter if you over or underachieve each day - you will know exactly how many you need to get everything you want!

*Please note: if you don't have the pass, this spreadsheet is not for you and will calculate incorrectly.*

&amp;#x200B;

**There is a troubleshooting area at the bottom of the Read Me that can help you with potential issues that you might run into. If you still run into issues. Don't hesitate to make a comment in this thread and I try to get back to you ASAP.**

Please for the love of all the Yuumi Mains. Don't hesitate to write a comment in this thread if you find an issue with the spreadsheet or there is some incorrect information and I will get it fixed ASAP. I will post the updates in the spreadsheet. Remember that you need to recopy the spreadsheet so that you have all the updates applied.  - *I will always attempt to provide updates that don't require you to do this unless its absolutely necessary.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**A little side note:**

*Personally I am totally against this event pass system compared to the old system where you got tokens after each game instead of this system. It's a nerf for token gains if you play faster games and win more than you lose. Tbf. I don't know how the events where before Worlds 2021 because I began to play league more from that time compared to before.*

&amp;#x200B;

* Now with all the formalities out of the way. Happy grinding! \^\^

To think TF can throw cards with perfect precision that‚Äôs enough to literally become his auto attacks, paired with the fact that the power he brings with his throwing technique is strong enough to kill shit like Cho‚ÄôGath or Aurelian Sol is absolutely absurd.

leagueoflegends,"Global head of competitive operation, Riot games addresses that RNG was the only team playing with actual 35 ping while all other teams were playing with unstable latency.","Following extensive technical evaluation of the competitive and training environments during the first three days of the 2022 Mid-Season Invitational, we discovered following Day 3 that there was a discrepancy in the latency being reported in game logs for all matches versus what was being experienced in the Busan venue. To address this issue, we are making a configuration change starting with today‚Äôs competition in order to reduce the overall latency to the intended level. 

 
Additionally, because this issue specifically affected teams playing from Busan, the matches involving RNG were held with an unintended disparity in latency between competing teams. As a result, we have determined it is in the best interest of competitive integrity to replay all three of these matches. These replayed games will be finished with all other Group Stage competition by Sunday, May 15; the replacement games will be held beginning tomorrow. We apologize to our players, teams, and fans, and we will continue to work with players to monitor the playing environments in our commitment to maintain the tournament‚Äôs competitive integrity.

Dissapointing that it took this long to address, plus it seems like a drastic decision to annouce out of the blue. I also wonder what the Chinese fan reactions will be.

leagueoflegends,Lux Hitboxes,"This has been a problem which seems to have gotten worse over the years. Lux E doesn't show where it's going until it's too late, but prediction and positioning help us out of that, even if getting hit by one within its enormous hitbox can take half of your health as an ADC and even when you dodge it still serves as a zoning tool or crowd control until her Q is at least close to being ready.

But why doesn't her Q show the full hitbox in the animation? Too many times I've walked out of the way and towards her to still get rooted when my champion wasn't in the flight path of the ability, and somehow riot changed it to even root units who are side by side in S10. Morgana and Nautilus have been like this too. Leona, Blitzcrank and Thresh used to be like this too, but they seem to have been fixed as far as I'm concerned.

Her Ultimate, the only ability without a deceptive or unclear hitbox, has a cooldown almost as short as many basic abilities with high utility like Warwick's or Samira's W. And it also has a huge hitbox, clearcut as it may be. Why can't the cooldown reduction be temporary or conditional, like stacks that you lose when you die, or by casting with the reduced cooldown?

I understand that she's a mage for beginners, but why not make it so beginners playing against her don't have to precisely memorize an unseen boundary just to be able to tell when they're really not going to get hit? And if that really doesn't matter, why does she have enough movement speed to just walk away until her cooldowns are over (I guess that can be adjusted by longer cast times, but how long, and why bother when you can just make her either need her full kit to mortally punish the enemy for showing on her screen, or make it easier to know when you've dodged)?",1652417461

It‚Äôs my first time post on reddit, and I‚Äôm not good at English. 
I liked midlaner forellenlord, who was r1 in s2 by 3k elo. But that time my rank was only silver 1, also middle school student, so I didnt have any sight to watch pro play detail. I just watched lcs eu game without any analysis, but nowadays i am so curious what was forellenlord‚Äôs playstyle for mid laner. 
Did he was good at team fight, or roam, something like this, also what was weak point for mid laners. 
I have little memories that his laning phase did not offensive, prefer mage, not assassin meta / good at teamfight and good assisst for full game. 
Before last 9th week, ATN‚Äôs rank quite good. I wonder why after he kicked from atn any team did not take him. Thank you ;)",1652415344

We obviously do qualifications a bit differently in LOL but my current idea for how to translate it would be as such. Auto Qualified slots to second stage: LCK 2 LPL 2 LEC 2 LCS 1 PCS 1. Slots given for 1st stage of LCK 2 LPL 2 LEC 2 LCS 2 PCS 1 VCS 1 CBLOL 1 LCL 1 LLA 1 TCL 1 LJL 1 OPL 1.  CSGO has also done away with groups to adopt a Win 3 and your in lose 3 and your out system to determine advancement that I thing would work well with LOL. Finally a move I highly doubt riot would ever make but I would still like to see so that we can atleast reward the regions that do well would be to adapt the CSGO auto qualifications to the fit the new lol format. Putting it simply whatever seeds made playoffs the year prior determines the seeds that automatically qualify for stage 2 of the tournament. So if playoffs was 4 LPL and 4 LCK then next year's stage 2 would automatically have 4 LPL and 4 LCK and the first stage would essentially be a battle ground to determine who gets to challenge these titans.

evening *everyone*... wonder how much money Riot needs to make off Arcane and Prestige skin battle passes before we can afford to fix some of the simple client bugs? some of these things are annoying enough to expect from S1 or S2 'free moba game' Riot. But we're over 10 years into this thing and still getting gift notifications from 2 years ago? if you join a TFT match and exit when you leave you just cant play or use the client again til after the match is over anyways? at least once a day in a team of 4+ someone will not get a que notification and need to disband the party to reset group to fix it or log all the way off? not to mention, one friend of mine constantly gets DC'd off champ select giving us leaver ques and its not their internet or pc since it happens to only him on all 3 PCs in his household and never the others nomatter whos using which pc. I know it's not a bug, but is there really a need to still be manually forging 3 fragments into a key instead of just clicking to open a chest with 3 fragments or automatically fusing them? and another not bug but a (should be) obvious QoL update, when someone's in-game on valorant or LoR why not say 'in game-Valorant' under the name like it shows 'on line-Valorant'? seems like a no-brainer that got overlooked in the merging. While we are on QoL changes that would make loads of sense and not actual bugs though they feel like they could be considered 'broken', how about a 'submit feedback' button somewhere that isnt for bug reports to say what we do like and ask for things we want somewhere in-client and not need to hunt down a twitter post... some things just dont add up, y'know?

leagueoflegends,Hardstuck B3-4 looking for advice.,"Hi, Istarted playing S5 and was always Silver at the verge of Gold. Never could beat my promos but now I'm hard stuck at bronze for multiple seasons even though I have improved quite a few things. 

I started playing as adc this season after beeing placed in a lower Iron division can't remember if it was 3 or 4. And there the nightmare began. I focus quite a bit on CS instead of always fighting. I'm able to hit 7-9 cs/min on a regular basis (Still not 100% consitstant but its something i still work on). 

My supps didn't like that and loved to pick fights we shouldn't pick and I started to ignoring them because I knew that those won't take us anywhere. Well it ended almost everytime in them raging flaming and trolling. 

Result = sub 40% winrate bot.

Thats why i tried going mid and top. I ended up beeing at top and try to play pretty much the same way. keep it safe outfarm lane oponent don't pick stupid fights (e.g 1v5, 2v5, playing aram or even a 1v1 while beeing behind) and split push when enough enemies are visible and drake and baron are not up, focus onjectives etc. . Still get flamed for it but who cares (I watched a lot of guides and coaching and I'm pretty sure this is often the right call). But even outfarming them by 100-200% regularly I still have a 43% winrate overall. I managed to get it to 50% spaming Shen and GP top over the last 2 weeks for the last 20-40 games or so.  But i still lose LP I droped 1,5 divisions back to B4 in the last week alone with a 50% winrate. I generally lose more LP than I gain for a win. Stating to [OP.gg](https://OP.gg) I'm ace / mvp in about 40-50% of my games only loosing my lane very rarely when for example getting counterpicked by a teemo who knows that he can bully a Shen (Its rare but it happenes). My goal is always to at least go even on bad matchups.

I know this doesn't happen in all games but in a majority of them it looks like my team activly tries to throw the game as much as possible. I regulary have games where mid and bot die 15+ times in under 10 min while I'm like 2/0/0 or 0/0/0 in top.  Its still managable to win some of them if the team starts to listen to danger pings baron calls instead of aram etc. I'm by no means a perfect player but I feel like I just don't belong there (I know we all heared it a 1000 times) I just see players all the time going for insenly stupid fights just mashing their heads together and hoping that it works somehow. Its like they expect their enemy doesn't use their abilitys or has none at all and just lets them kill them while completly ignoring farming. √çts just so damn frustrating that those obvious things just get ignored.  And they often don't even realize that we only won because I had a big enough gold lead to stall out the game long enough so we could win. Just had a  13/4/18 Shen game where I was top kd/a, kills, gold, cs, structure dmg and champion dmg (Yes top dmg Shen not going a weird dmg build) and my team flamed me for not joining fights all the time or not ulting the jungler who decided it was a good idea to solo stay in their base after we just barely won a teamfight and managed to get mid inhib as a 5/9/xx  kayne (Baron was up and pretty much free) . Even pinging him couldn't change his mind and I got flamed for not ulting (Because ulting into a 5v2 instead of finishing baron is the better play duh). We won but 3 of my m8s had litterly 0 clue what was going on the whole time. It was more like we won last fight oh there is an adc in the enemy jungle. Uhh where team? Why screen grey?

This elo also seems to have serious smurfing problem. The gaps are often insane. 200+ cs 30+/0/xx at 20 min is something i got pretty used to seeing (Even though most of accuesed players are either not smurfs or their main is definatly not high elo but i have teammates and enemies which are on a 10 game winstreak with those stats quite often but somehow more often as an enemy). 

I tried changeing my playstayle a few times but trying to roam more or participating more in tf or donating as much kills as possible often ends in me loosing to much cs, gold and or towers and feeling pretty weak in the late game and then see them donating shutdown after shutdown for no reason (because ape stronk looking at grey screens half of the game)

The most common tips are just cs better and don't die to get out of iron/bronze/silver but this just doesn't seem to work for me. I feel like I play a lot better  and having a game plan than back when I was S1 but I still can't even manage to constantly win Iron 1 games.

I know one thing i need to improve on is csing while trading with the enemy laner in the early game so i can get more constant 8+ cs/min while still denying farm but I'm at b4 where a sub 4/cs min is nothing uncommon. I feel like statistically speaking I should climb with my stats but like i mentioned I just droped 1,5 division loosing a lot of progress with a 50% winrate. 

If you got this far I'm obvousily making mistakes and have bad games too. I'm have partly paralized right hand and other problems. Games like league keep my brain active and challange me wich is very important at my state.

I obviously can't change my teammates and therfore try to focus on my own mistakes but I'm stuck.

I have a 4.2/1 KDA on Shen and a 3.73/1 KDA on GP while avaraging around 5 cs/min on shen and 6.5 cs/min on gp per game (Like i said i still need to work on consistency espacially in hard matchups where I always fall behind as soon as the enemy realize they can bully) I stoped waiting for jung to help me out because top seems to not exist for them in most games and I need to learn to play without them.

I was thinking about searching for a duo partner but looking at 90% of my teammates I don't want to duo with them at all. And why should somebody in silver or gold duo with a  random b4?. I also have tried duo with randoms a few seasons ago and even speaking to them about not flaming (Its pointless and I hate it you are busy typing and the target gets tilted even more) it ALWAYS ended in them flaming in the second or third game in teamchat.

Nobody.

Nobody is playing traditonal ADC unless its a cheese comp with Lulu/Twitch &amp; Yumi/Twitch

leagueoflegends,"With every shield and heal getting nerfed next patch for the damage reduction changes, Rell is getting double nerfed while Leona is not.","Rell has the big shield on her dismount and a heal on her Q for both her and an ally she's bonded to, which heals 1o to 30 HP plus 5% missing health.

Riot intended for Rell and Leona to be aligned in that enjoying one was ideally to mean enjoying the other, however Rell crashed down onto the Rift and instantly got left behind cause of that unholy 250 move speed.

Riot is upping the base and scaling HP of every champ, on top of shifting armor and MR growth, and nerfing heals and shields across the board. Leona does not have a heal or shield in her kit, her tank steroid comes in the form of bonus resistances on her W. 

Rell's tank comes from her shield and heal. She'll be double dipped with nerfs while already being one of the least played champions in the game.

I know Riot has mentioned she's in the discussion for a rework, and personally I'm excited for it. I love her mounted knight lancer theme, but find that she just feels very rough to play, despite how much time I've put into her.",1652395783

Could be a useful endgame siege tool, maybe a replacement for the triple inhib just giving some more minions? Could help with riot's goal of allowing for earnable snowball mechanics, but maybe they could also give extra gold/xp to help with riot's other goal of allowing for healthy comeback mechanics. It would also make people actually think about whether taking an inhib is beneficial or not, something players seem to struggle a lot with.

If you buy first High Noon Talon Border Set Bundle at 2220RP and then LoL MSI 2022 High Noon Pass Bundle at 1650RP

If you do it the other way, so first LoL MSI 2022 High Noon Pass Bundle at 2650RP, and then the High Noon Talon Border Set Bundle would cost only 320RP 

Which make --&gt; 2650+320=2970RP 

900RP difference, please, don't make the same mistake I did.

i'm a prestige skin collector and absolutely love league of legends. However since i can't waste all my money and time on the game even tho most of those 2 get invested into my account i always had to wait for my prestige points or mythic essences. I didn't think much of it because they literally just put her in the mythic shop wich states that it will rotate in patch 12.12.  


I randomly checked the shop a few minutes ago and realized that the Senna skin wasn't in it anymore. I checked everything i could on the internet to find out why she was gone and all i got was 1 single post on the r/Sennamains where i dug a bit into the comments to find a tweet where it stated that it would be gone in patch ([https://twitter.com/kenadamsnsa/status/1523746618532540416?s=21&amp;t=8F0a9XUA1-rMOdXmf78IDQ](https://twitter.com/kenadamsnsa/status/1523746618532540416?s=21&amp;t=8F0a9XUA1-rMOdXmf78IDQ))  


Right now i'm really dissapointed for missing on the border and icon for her since i already have bought most of the prestige skins with everything they came with and hope to atleast get the chance for me and other players who didn't know this get another chance on buying the skin with it's border and icon.",1652391115

leagueoflegends,Don‚Äôt Let the Release of the EDG Skins Distract You From the Fact That Zoe Is in the Top-10 for Waiting on a Skin,"Remember: if e-sports skins didn't count for Gangplank, then they don't count for Zoe.

Here are the facts: 

* 657 days have passed since her last skin (Arcanist)
* Considering Zoe has been released 1633 days ago, that means over 40% of her lifetime *as a Champion* has been spent waiting for a new skin
* 145 of the 159 Champions will have received a new skin or had one revealed (over 90% of the roster)
* Zoe is in the top-10 in terms of how long a Champion has been waiting
* 11 new Champions have been introduced
* Of those 11, 7 will have received an *additional* skin after their release
* 61 Champions will have received two skins
* 21 more Champions will have received *three* skins
* 5 Champions will have actually received ***four*** skins
* And there's 2 Champions who will have received ***FIVE*** skins
* This means that 89/159 Champions have will have received 2 *or more* skins since Zoe's last one (over 55% of the roster)

&amp;#x200B;

 And there's more:

* Of those 89 Champions who've received two or more skins since Zoe's last skin, 75‚Äînearly 85% of them‚Äîalready had *at least* as many skins as Zoe does (plenty of them already had more)
* Of the 24 Champions who've received a Prestige Edition since Zoe's last skin, 19‚Äînearly 80% of them‚Äîhave also received at least one *entirely separate* skin (that is, a different skin besides the regular version of the Prestige Edition itself)

So the mere fact that Zoe's gotten a Prestige Edition shouldn't exclude her from getting a new skin.

&amp;#x200B;

The numbers speak for themselves. Zoe is being neglected for skin attention.",1652390865

leagueoflegends,"LCS Champion vs LPL Champion, Pro League's closest matchup","Now that EG look pretty well locked in to make the bracket stage, I thought I would give everyone a tour of Pro LoL's closest rivalry: The LCS Champion vs the LPL Champion.

Event | Scoreline
---|---
2015 MSI | TSM 0 - 1 OMG
2016 MSI | CLG 1 - 1 RNG
2017 MSI | TSM 1 - 1 WE
2018 MSI | TL 1 - 1 RNG
2019 MSI | TL 3 - 3 IG
2021 MSI | C9 1 - 1 RNG
2021 Worlds | 100T 1 -  1 EDG


All this adds up to a 9-8 scoreline in favor of LPL.  Across MSI and Worlds, the NA and China champions are virtually deadlocked.  They've played to a tie in every event they've faced each other, except at 2015 MSI where they only played once.

All that translates to a **47% winrate for the LCS champion when facing the LPL champion**.  That number is ridiculously high, considering that NA also has a 46% winrate internationally overall since 2014 (142-164)

Looking at NA's winrates vs every region in general, you will see NA fairing extremely well vs LPL in general

Opponent | Record | Winrate
---|---|---
Wildcard | 41-13 | 76%
Vietnam | 10-4 | 71%
PCS/LMS | 27-15 | 64%
Europe | 24-33 | 42%
**China** | **27-37** |  **41%**
Korea | 13-62 | 18%
Total | 142 - 164 | 46%

This is once again a huge statistical anomaly.  North America plays about as well vs China as they do vs Europe, even though the gap in overall winrate between China and Europe is large.",1652387775

Sorry if this is a stupid question, my friends has told me the game is in beta so I ofc understand that there's certain things that won't be in place yet. However, I've played a few other mobas before so I know there's usually a support role too. And I saw that there was a support tab in champion select, however there was no champions there yet. However all the other ones had loads! Such as marksmen which I believe is the crossbow icon. So my question is, is there an ETA on when they are releasing some? I have really enjoyed playing support in other mobas and i'd love to get to try some in this one too! thanks",1652386415

leagueoflegends,Olaf's rework is live and it's awful. What now?,"Can't  you stop forcing an autoattack kit into a champ originally designed as  an ability caster? It has long ability animations, it has no mobility,  no matter how much attack speed and life steal (without spell vamp) you  give him he doesn't benefit that much of them, ... Right-click Olaf just  doesn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

In  the patch notes you said you think the rework would define the champ's  identity... by erasing his Q based gameplay that have been the core of  his identity for 12 years. And turning him into a right click champ with  a shield (yet another one, because apparently there weren't already  enough in the game). As a joke is not bad, a bit mean, but it's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Next,  for real, please do something decent. Don't continue messing up with  Olaf and ruining the experience of the few people that despite your  doings still play him.

&amp;#x200B;

The  berserker never have been in a better state than before you nerfed him  to the oblivion for the first time 10 years ago. And that kit wouldn't  be overtuned today. So if even after all this time you still have no  idea about what to do with him, at least bring back the Season 2 kit  until you manage to figure out something better.",1652385462

I have been having a trouble all the time i play rankeds, its not that i stuck or anything, as an Iron, i dont have all the champions, and thats quite a trouble. I main Sett, my ranked loop is, i play Sett, i get bored after 7 games, then i start trying all champs and constantly changing through jungle and toplane and i dont have the sufficient confidence to bring my jungle or anything that isnt Sett top to a ranked game. I struggle to have fun in rankeds and play something different, because apart from Sett all champs are like: Oh i love this champ, i will main it! 10 games later i completely forgot that champ existance, its like phases. But i cant be a Sett OTP because i get bored. For example, now im selecting in between Camille and Viego. How can i decide in between two lane or champions?

leagueoflegends,Rework Taliyah is a better anti-dash Mage than Vex.,"When Vex was being marketed, she was stated to be the new mage of anti-dashing, the next Poppy. But on her release, we were sorely mistaken, where she was just another champion with a RESET-able dash herself and a passive that allowed her to CC, and ""punish"" people who dash/blink by just dealing extra damage to them. 

Vex's anti-dash mechanics were not satisfying at all and more or less just an arbitrary way to give her alot of damage. 

Rework Taliyah on the other hand.

A mage with no dashes, but with her new E, punishes dashers not only with damage but a stun if dashers go across her E. It's basically like Poppy W but on a Mage-like spell. Seeing dashers come to a full stop after dashing across Taliyah's rework E is so.... DASHING. I love it.

leagueoflegends,I know the real reason why RNG don't use headsets.,"Because the headsets and white noise can not only prevent players from being disturbed by the outside noise, but also prevent them from hearing their coaches' voices.
On the stage of LPL, players, coaches and referees communicates through a special radio system, which is shown in the picture of the link. The sound system cannot be transported and assembled in their house. Therefore, it's unable for them to connect coaches into the system. Players communicates with referees through online voicecall, but it would be totally unfair to let coaches carrying laptops or smartphones into the room.

leagueoflegends,Gaining a mental edge over your opponents,"Have you guys ever thought about, or done anything, In order to gain a mental edge on your opponents in league?

I've heard about when it comes to physical sports, one example of what I've heard was something along the lines of;

""If your opponent is beating you, ask them what they are doing different than you, and how they are able to perform the way that they are, they will get out of their flow-state and start focusing on what it is they are doing, potentially throwing them off their game""

Using emotes is another way, although I don't think it does much nowadays since you can just mute them, and it's honestly just pretty obnoxious behavior

I've personally said stuff like ""First time * insert champ here*, please go easy on me"" but I havn't exactly measured my success

Or stuff like ""Hi my name is Jacob, im 11 years old and my brother let me try league on his PC""

It feels like the opponent will either relax, figuring that they're gonna go easy on an 11 year old, or they're gonna become increasingly nervous, because they don't wanna be the guy who lost to an 11 year old

leagueoflegends,"What are all the things that challenges could, but aren't (hopefully only for now) retroactively track?","So since yesterday the champion collection ones have been fixed. 

But I can see plenty of challenges that could be retroactively applied (the data is displayed either in game - ARAMs played) or can be viewed on op.gg (pentakills, win-loss ratios on champions, ranked games played).

Anything else you can think of?

It would really be good if those things could get tallied and displayed. There is only one reason I can personally come up with that stands in the way of things - server transfers. I don't know how much of the data follows the account, it gets severed in op.gg. Is that the cause of the kerfuffle? Or does the account hold the data properly on Riot's own servers?

There's a lot of beef around Reddit about people ""losing"" 10 years of progress, and though mine isn't nearly as long, I, too, feel the salt and the feeling of, idk, missing out, losing some part of my account's history, being ""robbed of the grind"", for lack of better words.

I don't wanna sit here and rag on Riot, because I genuinely really do like this feature. And a lot of the challenges are fun and creative and I'm looking forward to collecting them.

leagueoflegends,I hate the new scoreboard design and borders. I want my old one back.,"I know people were excited about the addition of challenges, but I think the redesign went too far. They could have incorporated challenges gracefully without taking over the entirety of my card and post-game stats page. I loved my old summoner icon level border and my friends loved theirs too and now they are replaced with these weird huge ones. I also hate having to click through all these pages on the team cards instead of it being a one click summary for each player in the load screen. 

My absolute biggest complaint is how cluttered and poorly designed the new post-game stats screen / scoreboard is. It was so concise and clean before. It took me forever to locate where my letter grade even was. I personally have no interest in seeking out challenges, I had been working for months to get level 7 on a champ and my mastery work feels slightly stomped on now. I am excited for the addition of challenges but geez the client was so nice before why did they have to ruin it, just make a challenges tab with all the progress and info on the home page and on the scoreboard page and place for display and call it done. It would have been so easy and clean.

The fact that Sunderer is still the most bought Mythic on him its crazy, and it's 100% due to pro play

When, starting from the middle of Season 11, both ISB/Kraker have far suppased it in WR, and most high elo Viegos build those item.

There's also that time, that a Pro player insisted on building Sunderer on GP even tho Sunderer's empowered effect (no, not sheen), doesn't apply to barrels

First, the seemingly weird  decision to change position select to the bottom of the screen off set instead of the 2 icons under your name.  The second the post match ui.  Why is it so cluttered?  It feels like they keep shoving more and more into the design without fundamentally re-designing the client from the ground up.  2 lines of text in post match, then when you decided to chat, it covers up half the screen to chat.  What is happening, and why does it feel like someone is pushing cool design changes, BUT not building around it.  It is band-aid fixes rather than a fundamental re-work.",1652378121

leagueoflegends,How do you have fun while playing the ADC role?,"(Just to clarify, the ""you"" in the title actually refers to you specifically, not a nebulous ""anyone in the world"").

Disclaimer: I'm not ranting about the ADC role, I'm asking for help in changing my gameplay because I must be doing something wrong.

Hey, folks. I've not been having a lot of fun playing league lately, and I analyzed my games until I noticed the pattern. Whenever I play ADC, I feel awful. Win or lose, the emotions felt throughout the course of the game are just negative.

To provide some context, I usually play support, and I love it. I can freely roam the map, helping whoever needs help, laying down vision so my team has a nice bright map to make plays on. Sometimes I play top lane. I can get nice and beefy, so I can safely push out any given lane. If the enemy sends two people to attack me I can usually go 1 for 1, or if they send 3, that's fine, I stall for time and my team takes something elsewhere.

But when I play ADC, it feels so... limited? I don't really know how to describe it. After the 20 minute mark I don't feel like I'm playing league of legends anymore, I'm playing the game of ""Where am I allowed to stand on the map?"" And the answer is usually ""Inside my base or at the nearest tower"".

I can be safely fed, but I can't actually fight anyone. Even a sufficiently even support can pop me if they land a CC from out of vision. I feel like I'm reduced to following whatever play my team wants to do, and hoping against hope that no assassins jump over a wall and delete me. Because even if I position in a spot I think is safe, there's not much I can do about a talon or zed or leblanc who flash &gt; ult &gt; ignites me. I just have to hope that one or even better two people on my team are watching me to get some sort of interrupt CC off, which rarely happens in solo Q.

So, how do you have fun? How do you enjoy this role? What do you do, in game, to achieve an experience where after 20 to 30 minutes, win or lose, you can take a moment afterwards to say, ""That was fun, I enjoyed that.""? Because I can do that for any role but ADC, and I want to figure out what I'm doing wrong.",1652375601
leagueoflegends,Server Outage doesn't lead to Loss Prevention?,"Ranked Queues went down for NA last night because players were lagging mid match and dropped from the game. I recall that Riot used to issue loss prevention when these type of things happened, but do they no longer support this feature?

I was in a match where we were clearly in the lead but ended up losing due to the above issue, and it's still marked as Defeat today. I'm not necessarily complaining since it's only one match, but I wanted to understand what happens in these scenarios and how Riot responds.",1652375594
leagueoflegends,since everyone is in korea now lets appreciate the korean soloq experience lol,,1652375549
leagueoflegends,What do i do to be useful for my team as a nunu in mid/late game?,"I love playing nunu but i only see myself as a useless team member mid and late game. If youre on equal terms with your opponents, your only source of damage is your ult which is cancelled way too easily. Q barely scratches the enemy mid/late game, E is just a stun with a huge activation delay. So because of this, Nunu builds tank. But thats also an issue.

I build sunfire, tabis, thornmail and randuins. After building these items i STILL feel like a really weak tank. I just get obliterated by nearly anyone. Nunu with these items just feels so weak. Its like youre a squishy, not a tank. Youre meant to be the frontline for your team, but you die just as soon as the AD carry if you go frontline. No matter how well i perform in early game (where nunu is most probably the strongest) it doesnt matter, because i fall off a cliff later on and i can only help secure objectives with my Q SMITE for my team.

Game starts. I gank alot. 3/0/4. Huge jg gap. Mid game starts. I lose all of my dmg. I build tank. I get deleted by anyone on the team while building tank. A good ult (used against braindead enemies) can still do decent dmg. Late game starts. Now, i cant even get close to the enemies. I get burst everywhere i go, my engages with W are extremely hard to pull off , my ult does absolutely no dmg and its a rare occurence where it actually hits.

Any help? What can i do to be useful",1652375366

leagueoflegends,League of Legends needs full team voice chat,"I keep reading threads about how duos are unfair because they get voice chat and can make coordinated plays.  Then I hear people say they want to be able to play with their friends and that player numbers will decline if duo is removed.  I think both sides have valid arguments.

Why not just add team voice chat for everyone, now everyone can make coordinated plays just like their favorite pro players.  People are also less likely to be toxic over voice chat than they are in text chat.  Plus just like we have the mute button for text chat right now we can always have a mute button for voice chat just in case a small number of trolls want to ruin everyone else's good vibes.

From my perspective there's no downsides to adding full team voice chat.  Valorant has it, DOTA has it, Smite has it, pretty much every MOBA outside league has it.  The year is 2022 it's time for League to get with the times.",1652375101

leagueoflegends,where can I find high elo flex players to play with?,"title basically, I'm d3 in flex and I am looking to hit master this season in flex. I mostly play with friends, but I am solo a lot of the times or we just need one because we are 4 and we end up playing aram in the end. when I play solo though, the queue times are always hella long, often stretching to 10+ mins.

is there like a website, facebook group, discord server or anything like that, where I can find people that are looking for a game? I know there is the league of legends server but since I am on eune there are not many people looking there, especially ones that are plat+ in flex, so that one is already out of the picture. when I look on euw section on that server however, there are quite a lot more players than in eune section",1652374311

leagueoflegends,Riot banned me for cloud gaming Nvidia GeForce Now,"Hi, guys. My name is Alexei and I am from Ukraine. I've been playing League of Legends since 2015 and a lot of curiosities have happened, but this one struck me. 
One day my friend decided to give me his account and leave the league. That was in 2019. Actually, he changed his email and I played from his account for a year. The account-sharing system didn't notice it and I played that way until mid-2020, and then I left the game for a year. Now I'm back, but I have a very weak computer and so I used the NVIDIA GEFORCE NOW cloud service. I had experience playing The Witcher 3 from my phone, so I didn't expect any problems. I started the league, played for a week with a free subscription, re-accessing the game every hour, but after another game, I couldn't log in and saw ""Account suspended"". I wrote to the technical support of Riot, but the evidence given by me: login, nickname, IP, city where I created my account, the last 4 digits of the card I used for shopping, was not enough. YES, I WAS GIFTED AN ACCOUNT IN 2019 AND IT'S KINDA FORBIDDEN, BUT WHY DIDN'T YOUR SYSTEM BAN ME THEN? WHY DO YOUR SUPPORT AGENTS JUST TURN A BLIND EYE TO THE PROBLEM? I WASN'T BANNED FOR BEING GIVEN AN ACCOUNT 3 YEARS AGO, I WAS BANNED FOR PLAYING THROUGH NVIDIA GEFORCE NOW. 

Guys, I don't know who to ask for help, but I hope you all can help me. Yes, my account could have been blocked, but it should have been done 3 years ago, not now.",1652372890

leagueoflegends,Some points about the DNS - banned team in VCS from the last week's thread,"If you guys remember this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ufynaq/vcs\_qualifier\_team\_dns\_is\_disqualified\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ufynaq/vcs_qualifier_team_dns_is_disqualified_for/), here‚Äôs some points I got through the DNS incident after investing in deep.

\- VCS B is played online, under surveillance of a referee, and DNS tried to buy the referee.

\- Based on community reports, Garena investigated &amp; found out there are alot IPs login &amp; out these tournament accounts, especially these IPs at difference provides (300km aways from team Gaming house). To verify the strange, Garena sent an email to DNS &amp; requested some proof to explain the strange.

\- DNS needs to explain why 4 of 5 accounts didn‚Äôt sign up by the correct DNS member, while they also need to show the playing history (Tristana &amp; TF) in which they played super well without any training before (in tournament accounts). DNS have 48 hours to defend by sending proof back to Garena.

‚Üí From my understanding, Garena is already quite sure about the fault of DNS before requesting this data. So the information that DNS are disqualified for ‚ÄúPlaying Tristana and TF‚Äù is, in fact, just a part of the investigation and is provided as a piece of evidence, and shouldn‚Äôt be viewed as a sole reason for their disqualification. The email that the officials sent them was cut short to make it seem like Garena is unreasonable and shady to disqualify them. They even wrongly quoted the officials‚Äô email, which is ‚ÄúIn 3 months, you haven't used Tristana and Twisted Fate, that seems suspicious to us, so we are going to disqualify you guys"". There is just no way Garena or any other organizations could use that kind of statement.

*P/s: Garena post -* [*https://www.facebook.com/vcslmht/posts/8080068378671734*](https://www.facebook.com/vcslmht/posts/8080068378671734)

So we do have many reasons to believe that DNS are actually guilty, and they have actually bribed the referee and faked their whole line-up in the tournament. And when the things they did got exposed, they shed phony tears‚Ä¶I know some of you guys are anti Garena, and I do. But honestly, I believe that they did the right thing in this case.

leagueoflegends,Sion got nerfed. Sion didn‚Äôt really get nerfed. Sion‚Äôs WR increased.,"Can someone explain how did that happen? It‚Äôs not like his counter got nerfed and he took advantage, neither his build got any more innovative. Much the reverse, Hullbreaker got nerfed at early stages of the game making Sion have less resistance before lv16

He is still the same but his WR increased to 49.4%.

His nerfs weren‚Äôt even that significant to begin with since you wanna get cs or kill other champions when you die so it‚Äôs not like players had to re-imagine his play style founding a new stronger strategy.

leagueoflegends,"The problem with challenges is people will solo lose games trying to ""achieve"" some challenge","So before I get into challenges here's a quick story on statistics first.

I remember one time I was playing and only got 7.2 cs a min in a game that turned into a huge fiesta and my friend who was a higher rank watching the whole thing telling me my cs/min is why I wasn't in a higher tier.

I sat there thinking did you even watch the game? Do I go for 10 cs/min and let my jung invading without vision/knowledge spoon feed a blue kayn going lethality against a team with no tank?

Statistics are a metric but they are not comprehensive, a single roam could win a game but you lose xp/cs in the process, farming while a skirmish that kills a team mate to get an item just before a major objective might be the difference in the last team fight.

The reality is one size can't fit all but the game is promoting this concept of stats &gt; all. cs/min, vs/min and so on.  While having these be high is never a bad thing if you chasing these stats ends up costing a baron, soul or being late to a 40min tf because everyone and their mother is telling you, you need to get them higher to climb or get better at the game then that affects gameplay. This use of stats is however unavoidable.

Now with challenges the concept is you're ""bronze"" if you haven't achieved this that and whatever. So which is it? Are we platinum in solo que ladder but have silver challenges? So therefor we actually boosted? Are we gold in the ladder but have diamond challenges therefor my teammates are always at fault?

People are going to lose games chasing challenges and that single handedly affects gameplay to achieve some rank that has nothing to with the current game being played and what needs to be done to win it. While eternals are for the most part just a tracking mechanism and shouldn't really affect gameplay that much. I have however seen on occasion some people do some stupid things to get some ### of a stat with eternals.

An example is there is one challenge where you get points for not chatting in a solo que game? Really? What if you see something that you need to say, like said champ just got their core item be careful, but muh challenge? It will happen, and this is just one example.

Challenges are fine as a stat tracking mechanism but with its current ranked system it will almost certainly become another metric to judge people by and therefor should be changed so it doesn't affect gameplay.

leagueoflegends,Snowballatility‚Ñ¢ and how it impacts Esports (The Esports Analyst Club Journal),"Hey, I'm Jack J and I work in the AI &amp; Esports/Gaming space! (I brought you [jung.gg](https://jung.gg/) and that personality/champion recommender on [itero.gg](https://itero.gg/) )

Each week I write an article for the publication [The Esports Analyst Club](https://medium.com/the-esports-analyst-club-by-itero-gaming), this week is on my favourite custom metric: **Snowballatility**‚Ñ¢, or in other words: how does Gold impact the Champions win rate. 

Would love to hear your thoughts below!  


  
Let me ask you a question‚Ä¶

Imagine you‚Äôve just loaded into the last game of your Platinum promotional series and your team decides to group together, just in case the enemy invades.

You‚Äôve read them like a book. They head into your jungle to meet their demise. You clean ace them, with your Top laner securing a Penta Kill. He returns to base with 1600 Gold to spend.

The question is, if you could choose which Champion your Top laner was playing ‚Äî who would it be? Ignore their current win rates. Take a second and actually think about it.

But why that Champion over any other? Does it really make a difference, isn‚Äôt 1600 Gold going to be just as effective on anyone?

## The Gold Multiplier

Today, we‚Äôre talking about a metric that I call ‚ÄúThe Gold Multiplier‚Äù, but from my example above you may prefer the term *‚ÄúSnowballatility‚Äù* (or not, depending on how much you like to abuse the English language).

The simple explanation is: how does Gold impact a Champions win rate?

Mathematically, we calculate it like so:

* Find the 66th percentile of Gold @ 10 minutes. In other words, which value would mean that 66% of games are below it and 33% are above it.
* Flag all the games where a Champion is in this top 33% of Gold @ 10 (i.e. all the games where the Champion is notably ahead).
* Compare the Win Rate of these games vs. the Champions average game.

So, if a Champion had a 50% win rate but won 65% of their games when they were ahead at 10 minutes, their Gold Multiplier (*snowballatility*) is 1.30x (0.65/0.50).

Here‚Äôs a look at some values\* from Top laners:  


[Top Lane Champions Gold Multiplier When Ahead](https://preview.redd.it/4sa0tn1pg2z81.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ced74ad39e3d4981819c7c132f851b9d6e883d12)

 

* *All data is from patch 12.6, Diamond 2+ games from EUW, NA &amp; KR. Minimum 1,500 games per Champion shown.*

What surprised me when I first did this exercise was Renekton being the lowest. I thought he was a snowballing Champion? Get him ahead and win the game, right?

We have to differentiate the **probability** of a Champion getting ahead from its **effect**. Let‚Äôs take an ADC example for this one. Imagine Draven and Twitch. Who is the most likely to snowball? Draven. Who would be more likely to carry a game with a level 1 penta? Twitch.

It‚Äôs the same for Renekton, he has all the tools to get ahead but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs the best when he‚Äôs there.

## To be ‚ÄúEconomic‚Äù

If you watch any amount of professional play, you‚Äôve probably heard the term ‚Äúeco(n)‚Äù before. It‚Äôs short for ‚Äúeconomic‚Äù and it refers to how well a Champion or player performs with low resources. Or in other words, it‚Äôs the antithesis of snowballing. *Antisnowballatility*, if you like.

We can calculate it in a similar way, except rather than looking at all the games where a player is in the top 33% of Gold @ 10, we look at the bottom 33%.

In English: How does being behind in Gold impact win rate? Imagine the example from the beginning of this article, except this time it‚Äôs the enemy Top laner who gets the penta kill. Who do you want facing them?

[Top Lane Champions Gold Multiplier when Behind](https://preview.redd.it/1fekojwrg2z81.png?width=405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56c1e7c292e1da19a40f0af6fcece31188c8749e)

 Malphite is a mountain, an immovable object. He‚Äôs going to be tough to kill. Even if you do, his ultimate ability still provides huge value in team fights. The same goes for Shen.

Irelia and Riven? Their duelists. They go in, zip around, deal huge amounts of damage, flash their level 7 mastery and type ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù in all chat. They offer nothing else. This playstyle doesn‚Äôt work so well if they‚Äôre considerably behind.

## Snowballing my way to Full Build

Whilst looking at this, a question occurred to me. Isn‚Äôt a Champions Gold Multiplier when ahead the same as their scaling? Think about it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs basically a metric to say how strong a Champion is with more Items, since that‚Äôs where the Gold goes. So, don‚Äôt Champions that scale well also snowball well?

To test this we first calculate a metric for ‚Äúlate game scaling‚Äù by taking all games in the top 33% of length and then comparing those win rates to the average. Again, in English: how many more games does the Champion win when the game goes late.

Now, we can compare our original Gold Multiplier statistic for when Champions are ahead, to the new scaling metric for when the game goes late.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Correlation between a Champions Gold Multiplier and their Scaling](https://preview.redd.it/ilnpvm7ug2z81.png?width=392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daaab26ed510f1eaf5470933b6f51dd09b5590a0)

 In general, there is a slight preference for ‚Äúsnowballers‚Äù to also be ‚Äúscalers‚Äù, but it‚Äôs far from a perfect correlation.

Look at **Volibear** ‚Äî he‚Äôs a monster when he‚Äôs ahead (1.46x) but really struggles during the late game (0.95x).

**Irelia** is below average with a gold lead (1.37x) but is above average past the 35 minute mark (1.02x).

**Ornn** is an outlier as his late-game prowess is related to his passive upgrades. Even if he got a penta kill at level 1, he still can‚Äôt unlock any new items for the team until later into the game.

**The Esports Impact**

Since I‚Äôm writing for [The Esports Analyst Club](https://medium.com/the-esports-analyst-club-by-itero-gaming), I should probably explain how this relates to professional play.

As an esports team you‚Äôll spend hours discussing how best to draft against an upcoming opponent. There‚Äôs the obvious factors, like the strongest Champion in the meta, counter picks and synergies or a players personal comforts.

However, choosing a Champion with the ‚Äúright‚Äù level of Gold Multiplier should also be a consideration. It‚Äôs all about identifying the play style and skill gaps across the map and exploiting these.

Do you have a famously strong top/jungle pairing who always get ahead? Are they facing the worst top laner in the league? Take Camille, Jayce or Yone, get ahead and snowball. Avoid Sion, Sett or Darius.

I have a perfect example of this, although I wouldn‚Äôt *exactly* call it esports. I‚Äôm a Platinum ranked player and I was playing off-role in our bi-weekly Clash tournament. The average Elo was around high Gold, but I ended up face-to-face with a Diamond I Irelia.

Luckily for me, I had this data handy and so locked in Malphite and accepted my fate. Yes, I went 30CS down but I never died.

Here‚Äôs my biggest contribution to us winning that game:

My level border for instance, shows the highest level border that I can achieve, not the one I have selected. For me it shows Blood moon, although I clicked Void (as an example). Also the Tokens aren't aligned properly and sometimes don't even show up. I've had a couple of friends complain about this as well. Overall good concept though.  
Additionally, what's up with the challenges themselves? So many of them are undoable, or is it just bugged? For instance one of the challenges is to buy 20 bruiser champs or whatever. I have all champs, hence can't get that (which i don't mind but it's still weird). Do we really have to start at 0 again, even though I've been playing for 9+ years? API goes back months for sure. Would be kind of lame to start at 0, just like when the mastery system was introduced. Maybe it's just me, but it doesn't seem very well thought out :D",1652362383

leagueoflegends,Understanding team comps and team synergies,"Hello everyone,
I follow some people like VeigarV2 and LS and sometimes i see them post drafts of proplay saying how X champion is really good into/vs the comps that are being drafted. My problem is that except some obvious ones (like picking a straight up counter like Poppy into a full dash comp) i dont understand what makes some champions strong vs others or in what scenario their kits are so much better vs something else. 
For example RNG vs RED 
RNG Drafted Lucian/Nami/Gwen/Galio/Viego and RED drafted wu/Draven/Nauti/Jax and Viktor as a last pick. Veigar said that Cassio or Anivia wouldve been insane as a r5 spot but why is that?
Is it the counter engage? In what way are Cassio and Anivia similar to Viktor here? 
Please enlighten me about comps and synergies i would like to enjoy the competitive world much better and i think this is a big part of it!",1652361857

leagueoflegends,"[Chinese translation] Interesting discussion on who the Chinese think is better, Caps or Xiaohu ?","Stumbled upon an interesting thread over on the bubu a Chinese lol forums, i've been using google translate so just be aware it's not 100% accurate. Surprsingly though, Chinese fans have a very positive image on Caps with the majority of the thread choosing Caps. Below are some translations

&amp;#x200B;

""*It's really hard to say. I personally think that the level of the caps playoffs so far can be regarded as the best in the world.*"" Tachibana Nozomi 

""*The best mid laner in the world without a Worlds Championship is Caps.*"" Talented Gunner Lu Benwei 

""*It is not unreasonable for Caps to be the strongest player without a Worlds Championship. Caps is more dominant than Xiaohu. Xiaohu has won five championships in nine finals, whilst Caps has won seven championships in seven finals, and Caps is even younger. When comparing their MSI results, Xiaohu has two titles one in top and the other in mid, Caps had to go blow for blow with Faker to win his title.*

*Currently Xiaohu is a little better, but Caps peak is higher. When it comes to Worlds, Xiaohu doesn't have much to show, in comparison to Caps who has consistently been outputting high perfomances, with two runners-up and one semi-final position. Even if he loses, he loses to the champion mid laner. Xiaohu is very good, but it really can't compare to a Caps.*"" Plants vs. Zombies Standalone 

""*Caps is 1-8 against Xiaohu. It's not even close.*"" Redamency11",1652360556

leagueoflegends,i have made a rework idea for Nasus,"In my eyes, Nasus has 2 huge problems
1 he's a stats checker means if he has better stats then u he wins, if he does not he loses, there is not that much skill expression in his kit aside from being a good farmer but that's not a skill u need only on Nasus u need that on all champions
2 by far the worst P in the game, which further makes his kit one of a status checker, there are so many ways u can give him sustain in the lane faze but this is arguably the worst way
Disclaimer: everything says here are nonuses to what his kit already has, unless it's mentioned that one thing will be removed 

P: Soul Eater: removed
Resurrection: every time a normal minion of his dies near him, Nasus can right-click on him to resurrect them in a Mummy, doing that will consume mana, those mummies will follow Nasus and heal him every 2 seconds, the mummies will not be in sink so that it's more of a passive heal rather than a burst of heal every 2 seconds, and the mummies will make sure to stay behind Nasus( idk how to explain but they will stay behind Nasus but as close to their team nexus as well, so that if Nasus makes a turn they dont just start advancing towards the enemy nexus) if Nasus has 20(20 or something like 50, it depends on how easy Nasus can gain and keep the mummies alive) when he dies they will give their life to resurrect him
Palace of Death and Rebirth: After lv 6 every minion that enters Nasus base will deal 30-50-70% (based on R lv) less damage, Nasus will also gain 20% of all gold of every minion killed, every stack he gains inside his team base will be doubled, in addition, his time to respond will be cut in half and will be ghosted for as long as he stays inside the base

Q: Siphoning Strike: the stacks now will further empower the duration of his abilities, he can Q the mummies he summoned for stacks, 2 for every mummy, but doing that too often will make the mummies to fear him and stop following him
Now it will also deal bonus damage based on the target missing health

W: Wither: a skill shot that comes from the back and goes towards Nasus, if it hits an enemy it will slow and silence them, if the enemy stays in Nasus E they will be stunned instead for 2 seconds
If the skill shot reaches Nasus he will gain a portion of his missing health back and ms
The distance it starts it's fixed

E: Spirit fire: the damage will scale based on the target bonus health, if Nasus kills a unit with Q inside of it the stacks he gains will be doubled
The radius of it is reduced by 30%, but the duration and size of it can be increased with stacks

R: Fury of the Sands: The damage around Nasus will be based on the number of stacks he has and the Health, Armor, and Mr based on the number of mummies he has 

Idk if this completely made him a non-stats checker champion but this will surely give him more skill expression, from making sure his mummies stay alive for when he has his R to his E being a skil shot",1652360422

leagueoflegends,GAM vs SGB/VCS MSI seeds,"Hi guys, many of you already knew SGB (Saigon Buffalo) is the 2nd seed from Vietnam (VCS) to the MSI. We always wonder how strong GAM (the 1st seed) is, compared to SGB. Here are some facts:

\- In the VCS tournament, GAM is the champion with 15 straight wins (31-3 in games), including 14 matches in the table stage (meet SGB twice), and a final 3-1 win over SGB in the final.

\- They also meet in the SEAGAME qualifier, where GAM is also the champion, defeated SGB (also 3-1), and commit to participating in SEAGAME instead of MSI. 

As a Vietnamese, I really proud of SGB and hope they can get us 2 seeds in Words this year. We might see both GAM and SGB show their style on the international stage.

Last but not least, VCS has been forgotten for 2 years, and now we are coming back for our position!",1652359757

leagueoflegends,Challenges UI - Riot valuing wrong information,"Challenges are here... Great right? Well, no.

Let's put aside the fact that challenges completely ignore years and years of gameplay stats and how confusing this new feature is.

I am here to talk about interface. There is this rule that the most important and most useful information should be the easiest to see and interact with. That's not what is happening with the new feature.

Right now, what is annoying me the most is that at the end of any game I play, the first thing I am forced to see is the challenges tab... I just spent 30-40 minutes playing a game and you think that's the information I want to look at?  I want to look at builds, scores, damage graphs, barons, drakes killed... I want to see something that recaps the game and challenges aren't it.

Then there is the fact that when I am trying to queue up for ranked there are 3 icons that mean pretty much nothing to me, yet they are 4x bigger than the roles icon.

I go look at my profile and guess what. Challenges are prioritized over match history and even ranked stats. 

Challenges are supposed to bring extra flavor to the game. But right now I feel like I went to a steakhouse and I am being forced to eat herbs and spices instead of an actual steak.

Many designers and programmers spent months making this for us and you want us to see. I get it. But do you really want players to be annoyed every time they see it?",1652355856

leagueoflegends,"so a bit ago someone posted about a painter champ, and i wanted to see if i could make one myself","basically someone posted this post [a](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/um6gmk/how_would_you_implement_a_painter_as_a_champion/)bout ""how to implement a painter"" or something

and i got an idea

&amp;#x200B;

p: the painter can see the plants, though they dont create vision around them

this will be a good tool for jungle tracking but also plays  a part in her q ability

&amp;#x200B;

q: paint the plant that normally resides in a location as your skill, replace your w if the plant hasnt been procced

painting a blast cone creates a knockback skill that can knock over walls, vision plant creates vision and the healing plant heals, yknow like the plants. this skill can be placed up to 300 units away from you

&amp;#x200B;

w: create an zone around you based on your q. base zone does base damage. blast does a burst of damage. scryer reveals weak spots, shredding a percentage of resistances of enemies while in the zone, berries makes it a regenerative mist instead,, providing a heal over time.

while q can heal and w can heal, the heal power would not be up to most sustain champs' heal power, as theres 2 abilities, though inconsistent for healing

e: the painter does  shortranged slamwith her paintbrush (thinking of lillie e but no dash and a straight line skillshot instead of a  circular target sorta thing) dealing more damage and stunning if you are closer to her

r: this is the one i have the most trouble with, but maybe something like

paint a  meadow on the ground, creating a zone which slows enemies and reduces their auto attack speed and speeds up allies

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

this champ feels like a yordle to me, with her gimmicky feeling abilities, but i think itd be a fun melee support to play. the only problem is i feel like as a melee champ in my imagining the healing will be lackluster because of not building heal power if you try to be a tanky support, but if you play moonstone build she will just not be able to get the pressure of her zones, nor the blastcone qs thta i imagine she could do safel, but i  imagine her as melee, so i think i want to keep that",1652354482
leagueoflegends,This tournament has truly pitted non-LPL fans against LPL fans,"Pretty sure most people here know that Twitch chat has been quite racist and sinophobic whenever RNG plays.

leagueoflegends,Why doesn't Riot implement pro play specific nerfs for champions that are problematic in only pro play?,"*But Pro players play the same game as solo queue players.* 

They simply don't, professional players practice hours a day as a 5 man with comms. This is impossible for solo queue players. Pro players do **not** play the same game as solo queue players, and our versions of the game shouldn't be balanced as if we did.

*Wouldn't it be better to rework problematic champions so that they have less pro skewed power?*

Yes, I agree so much in certain cases like Ryze, but better yet what if we had Ryze be playable in solo queue while we waited for his eventual rework? Not to mention this doesn't solve other champions that are left underpowered in solo queue due to pro skewed power such as Orianna, Syndra, Aphelios, Lee Sin, Azir, Corki, Jayce, Gwen, and Renekton.

*But Pro players wouldn't be able to practice these champions in solo queue.*

Given the purpose of pro play specific nerfs is to take these champions out of pro play this doesn't seem like a bad thing to me. 

*This change would widen the gap between upcoming pro players and actual pro players.*

Not necessarily. Though this does give us a chance to repurpose champions queue into an effective training tool for upcoming pro players.

*But this changes the pro play and solo queue meta*

There is already huge meta differences between the two, and the amount it changes the meta would be pretty minimal.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have any other reasons as to why Riot doesn't implement pro play specific nerfs feel free to say them in the comments, I personally just can't see a single reason why. It's not that the pros outweigh the cons, it's that there isn't a single real con to be found.",1652351997

But these champions are super mechanical and I've noticed that I could be playing way better if I knew my champion better. So I'm thinking of limiting my champion pool to these two only, Kat mid and Yone mid/top. What do you think about being a two-trick? Is it viable, since Kat/Yone are both quite mechanical? It should work much better than having more champions played, right? I can have Yone as a backup / more stable pick for mid because Kat has terrible laning, and I think I might fit in another top laner. Here I was thinking of playing Irelia, but I think that's quite overboard. Maybe just Garen/Shen as a backup.

leagueoflegends,Just got a great idea on how Riot can mitigate champ select griefers,"If you've played League for any amount of time you've likely come across people locking in troll champs in champ select and  trying to lose. There aren't many options on what to do when this happens except dodge. However, dodging in champ select results in a loss of LP and a queue timer for the dodger. 

Ironically, unless the the griefer is flagged and penalized they receive no penalty. With the addition of the report option in champ select this issue has been improved to some extent. However, the griefers still exist and you will still lose LP if you dodge.  


With the addition of this report feature in champ select it suddenly occurred to me that Riot could easily mitigate a large majority of grief and LP loss. **All they have to do is make it so that if a player who you report in champ select is penalized for holding hostage after you dodge, the dodging LP loss is removed.** Well, that's my idea. I think you guys might like it too. Really a simple solution. Shouldn't be too hard to implement either, given that the ""Instant Feedback"" feature already exists.",1652351424

leagueoflegends,The Tales We Tell - Chapter 13 Quinn," Hiya, here's the next installment!

Blurb of the Story

&gt;As the ranger-knight of Demacia, Quinn has a duty to find the mages responsible for killing the king. A trail of dead nobles leads her to the northern hinterlands and she returns with trepidation back to her hometown of Uwendale. Bad omens are many; dead wyverns and rabid wolves to name a few but the most alarming is the amassing visitors pilgrimaging to Uwendale for the Slayer‚Äôs festival.  
Among the visitors is the yordle Poppy, hoping to find the hero of Demacia to restore balance to the nation in turmoil.  
Past the Rocky Hinterlands, in a frozen lake surrounded by mountains, a young Notai perks up by the melody of his mother‚Äôs heart-song. He wakes his yeti-friend and they decide to cross borders and enter Demacia on a new adventure.  
Unknown to the three, the legends of Kindred will tie them all together as cursed masks of the Eternal Hunters' reappears once again in the world of Runeterra.

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

A gas lamp dangled on the ceiling, casting its cold light over two persons in the windowless room.

Quinn was silent and still, eyeing the blank-staring Kynon across the table like a hawk preying on a rodent. The man was cuffed, hands behind his back and arms bound to the chair.

The door behind the ranger-knight creaked open and the sound of armor rustled as Mealla, the warden of Uwendale entered. She shook her head once, signaling to Quinn that they hadn‚Äôt found any clues for how Tabitha was set ablaze.

A sinking feeling, like a sword underwater, cut through Quinn. No clues found could also be a clue. If there was nothing logical about it, then it‚Äôs simply pointing towards the supernatural or magical. The question was the motive at hand. She leaned over the table, taking a better look at the maskless Kynon. He looked much older than she‚Äôd expected. His hair and eyes matched the color of the room‚Äôs stony interior. Deep wrinkles lay folded over his gaunt face and the bright burn marks were a stark contrast to his pale skin.

‚ÄúKynon,‚Äù she said, ‚Äútell me again what happened.‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt meet her gaze. His voice was neutral when he retold his version of the incident for the fourth time. ‚ÄúYoung Nollaig had been sorting out the herbs too close to the hearth. Master Tabitha was too distraught to notice her surroundings and she accidentally stepped on the burning herbs. Before I knew it, she had turned into a pillar of flame.‚Äù

The same retelling, word for word. Even the cadence was the same monotone, but Quinn couldn‚Äôt decide whether it was due to shock or from practiced rehearsals.

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù Mealla said. ‚ÄúShe would‚Äôve needed to be dunked in a vat of oil for the fire to turn that big that fast, not from flammable herbs.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what happened,‚Äù Kynon replied.

Quinn agreed with her mother. She had stepped away from the hearth room for a moment to grab the books, still hearing the wake-tenders cry for help. She had managed to fill the bag to the brim when the cries suddenly turned to shrieks. It had been half a minute at most. It must be magic, but why was the wake-tender the target? Wasn‚Äôt a ranger-knight a more enticing prey?

She rubbed clammy palms over her sleeves, feeling comfort from the hidden daggers strapped to her underarms. It seemed that she wasn‚Äôt the only fidgeting person in the room, based on how the warden rested a hand on a crossbow by the belt.

More guards would‚Äôve helped, but they were outside and doing their best to calm the distressed villagers together with the mayor. Was that Kynon‚Äôs goal? But then, killing Quinn would‚Äôve caused the same kind of distress, if not more.

‚ÄúHow long have you studied under Tabitha?‚Äù Quinn asked.

‚ÄúSix months.‚Äù

That was a surprise. He had moved around the wake-tenders house with such familiarity that she would‚Äôve guessed a few years at least.

‚ÄúWhat did you do before then?‚Äù she asked, then added, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Kynon said in his impassive voice. ‚ÄúI lived happily with my family in a cottage north-east from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúNorth-east?‚Äù Mealla said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the land of the Arbormark.‚Äù

That could explain the accent, but Quinn wasn‚Äôt too versed with the Arbormarks while Kynon‚Äôs accent had a familiar ring to it. ‚ÄúAnd what made you come to Uwendale and seek an apprenticeship from our wake-tender?‚Äù she asked.

The gray man finally lifted his gaze, meeting Quinn‚Äôs. Her fingers twitched and she had to hold herself back from reaching a dagger.

‚ÄúI woke up to my home in ash and cinders,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWeak and wounded, I thought my life was over, then I saw them. The swirling blackness of Wolf and the white figure of Lamb.

‚ÄúThe Eternal Hunters were peering over something among the rubbles and I realized that it was my wife. They asked her what she would choose, and I prayed that she would fight for her life, to run from death as best she could. But Leanna asked for the arrow so Lamb pulled her bow and claimed my wife‚Äôs soul.

‚ÄúI waited for them to turn to me. I prepared myself to choose Wolf, to resist death. I knew that I would fail and that Wolf‚Äôs jaw would crush my neck but it‚Äôs what I had learned to do from the tally-men. Kindred turned towards me. White Lamb and Black Wolf, wearing masks of each other. They stared at me for a long moment as if pondering. Then they left.‚Äù

The gas light flickered as silence filled the room, each person muted with their own reasons.

The man named Kynon closed his eyes as if trying to listen to the echoes of his story.

The warden of Uwendale set her jaw, as if bearing pain from an old injury.

The ranger-knight bit her tongue and clasped her hands, suppressing the urge to throw a dagger between the man‚Äôs eyes.

Slowly, sound returned to the room. First from the scraping of Quinn‚Äôs chair against the stone floor as she rose. Then from her low voice saying with certainty, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from the Arbormark.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never said I was,‚Äù Kynon replied. ‚ÄúI merely said that I lived north-east from here. The warden interpreted the rest on her own.‚Äù

‚ÄúFurther than Arbormark?‚Äù Mealla asked. ‚ÄúSkaggornland?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Quinn said. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve recognized that accent earlier but it‚Äôs been a long time since I've heard a Noxian speak in our language.‚Äù

In a heartbeat, the warden pulled out her crossbow, loaded, and aimed at the man across the table. ‚ÄúA spy from Noxus? Are you working with the mages?‚Äù

‚ÄúLower your weapon, Warden,‚Äù Quinn ordered. She leaned closer to Mealla and whispered, ‚ÄúWe need him alive incase we need to decipher Tabitha‚Äôs books.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to bargain with a *Noxian*?‚Äù Mealla whispered back.

‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt work anyway,‚Äù Kynon continued. ‚ÄúWhat makes you think you could hurt me when even Lamb refuses to strike me down? When Wolf ignored chasing me?‚Äù

Not only was Kynon a Noxian, but one of the fanatics too. What had once seemed like a puzzle nearing its completion had been turned into something bigger. Was Kynon following someone‚Äôs orders from the Noxian Empire, or was he here by himself?

The warden opened the door, calling for whatever remaining personnel inside the barracks.

‚ÄúWhy here in Uwendale?‚Äù Quinn asked. ‚ÄúWhy Tabitha?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy my wife?‚Äù His tone was hard like iron, matching the color of his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy my daughter? Why not me?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to say anything?‚Äù Mealla asked.

The warden‚Äôs office had remained unchanged over the years with its single shelf, table and window. Quinn inspected the tomes on the shelf and picked out a ledger, rifling through it. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to say?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you would start with ‚ÄòI told you so‚Äô,‚Äù Mealla opened one of Tabitha‚Äôs books, her brow furrowed in concentration, then she shook her head in defeat, closing it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know where to start with these ciphers.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can gloat when all this is over,‚Äù Quinn replied. She closed the ledger and headed for the window. The festival should‚Äôve been bustling, but there was a worried tension in the air, clinging to the attendees and weighing their shoulders. The noon bell struck three times, she would be late for her meeting with Glendon the merchant, but more pressing things were at hand. Valor had also yet to return from his scouting of Jax.

‚ÄúDo you have any carrier pigeons?‚Äù she asked.

Mealla looked up from another one of Tabitha‚Äôs books. ‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to alert the High Council of the Noxian spy and of the mage activity here in Uwendale.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no proof of mage activity here.‚Äù

Quinn shot her mother a glare. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you report about mage activity, the mageseekers will come. They will‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what they‚Äôll do, *Warden*. They‚Äôll find all the mages, remove them, and make Uwendale a safer place.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs suspicion of murder and infiltration from hostile nations,‚Äù Mealla insisted. ‚ÄúNot magic.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said it yourself that she had to be dunked in a vat of oil for the flames to grow to that size. She wasn‚Äôt, so the only explanation left is magic.‚Äù

‚ÄúImprisonment or exile.‚Äù There was an edge in Mealla‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúThose are the only options for those afflicted with magic. Have you heard of the elixirs they force down on mage suspects?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish I had some on me, to be honest,‚Äù Quinn replied.

‚ÄúThe mageseekers torture people.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for the greater good of Demacia.‚Äù Just saying it tasted sour inside Quinn‚Äôs mouth, but she held fast and grabbed an empty parchment from a stack and began to write. ‚ÄúTrust the High Council. Trust that they know what‚Äôs best for our nation.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they know what‚Äôs best for Uwendale?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù Quinn snapped back. ‚ÄúBecause there‚Äôs a lot of things pointing towards you, Warden. The lack of rangers, the Slayer‚Äôs festival, the lack of security and huge influx of visitors, and that‚Äôs not even mentioning the Noxian spy who has been snooping around for six months right under your watch. You claimed I lost my edge when we discussed the wyvern corpse. Isn‚Äôt it ironic?‚Äù

Mealla stood her ground, taking on each accusation without a flinch or a grimace. She stood tall and straight like a Dauntless Vanguard.

‚ÄúWhat is happening here, mother?‚Äù Quinn said. Her voice wavered with the last word, shedding her stature of knight and breaking the formalities. She reached for her mother‚Äôs hand, squeezing it. ‚ÄúTell me what you‚Äôre hiding. Everything‚Äôs pointing at treason, but I know you better than that. Why is Uwendale holding a strange festival during this chaos?‚Äù

Mealla looked down at Quinn‚Äôs trembling hands. ‚ÄúThe Wings of Demacia,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great title. Fit for you and Valor. Reaching anywhere the High Council asks you to go, even behind enemy lines.‚Äù

Quinn‚Äôs eyes widened. She backed away.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think I noticed your slight limp?‚Äù Mealla continued. ‚ÄúHow you pull down your sleeves? Injuries are normal for a ranger, maybe expected even, but they‚Äôve run you ragged, Quinn. And how do they thank you? By giving you another mission, keeping you too busy to think for yourself.‚Äù

She caught herself tugging the sleeves again.

‚ÄúWhy should I say anything when you refuse?‚Äù Mealla said. ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre my superior and ordering me?‚Äù She took a step closer. ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre my daughter and want me to listen to your plea?‚Äù Mealla stared straight at Quinn. ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre a ranger who can‚Äôt trust their partner?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust?‚Äù Quinn‚Äôs knuckles turned white from how hard she clenched. ‚ÄúIs that what this is? You think that I didn‚Äôt say anything about my missions because I didn‚Äôt trust you?‚Äù

The warden didn‚Äôt reply.

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Quinn rolled up her sleeves, revealing the bruises and scars. ‚ÄúYou want to see the cut on my head?‚Äù She pulled back her hair. ‚ÄúFrom an enemy archer. Would‚Äôve sunk deeper into my skull if it wasn‚Äôt for my visor. And that one on my left leg, I got it in Trevale.‚Äù With each wound she exposed, Quinn grew bolder and fiercer with her words. ‚ÄúThis one, in Frostheld. Almost cut to the bone. I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move my arm anymore.‚Äù When she was finally done, it was as if she‚Äôd been dunked in ice water. Shocked, huffing and shivering, followed by a slow, rising heat.

‚ÄúNow tell me,‚Äù Quinn said. ‚ÄúTell me honestly, are you harboring any mages in Uwendale?‚Äù

‚ÄúNone.‚Äù The word came out so fast and so easy from the warden‚Äôs mouth, without hesitation, without thought.

Someone knocked on the door and Quinn gathered herself again and cleared her throat. ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

A boy with tumbleweed hair peeked in. Quinn recognized the boy as Adam and she spotted a bruise on the boy‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúAdam, what happened?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really sure‚Ä¶‚Äù The boy said. ‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶ Jax wants to talk to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen let him in,‚Äù Quinn said.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt want to enter Uwendale, he‚Äôs afraid that it might cause more problems. He‚Äôs waiting by the forest edge with some‚Ä¶ well, some dead watchmen.‚Äù

It took a few moments and some repeats for Quinn to extract the information from the ranger-in-training. None of it had sounded real but Quinn believed every word.

‚ÄúSend for the mageseekers,‚Äù she ordered Mealla, then exited the warden‚Äôs office before her mother had a chance to reply. She rushed back to Darragh‚Äôs workshop, finding Glendon the merchant outside and still waiting for her.

‚ÄúSir, eh, Lady Knight,‚Äù he spluttered, ‚ÄúHow may I, may I be of ‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYour stall had a full view of the Illuminator‚Äôs camp, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Quinn asked.

‚ÄúWhy, eh, maybe, I‚Äôm not sure that ‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you see any Illuminators leave the camp with anyone?‚Äù

The merchant furrowed his brow. ‚ÄúWell, yes, but isn‚Äôt that quite normal? People ask for their assistance all the time, don‚Äôt they?‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Glendon,‚Äù Quinn said, putting a coin in the man‚Äôs palm then walking past him. ‚ÄúKeep watch of them for me. I‚Äôll return with more questions later.‚Äù

While the puzzle was still missing some pieces, she had now enough to see a vague picture of the situation. As she entered the workshop, she hoped that Darragh had finished repairing her gear.

leagueoflegends,Why is riot pushing challenges so hard.,"Eternals flopped, not only did really invested league players not like them but casual league players didn‚Äôt care about them.

So instead of not making weird systems we didn‚Äôt need, or making them with the expectation they were going to be nesh, riot make it so it‚Äôs as in your face as possible. 

Pre game w8, every time you log in, after every match. The first thing you see is challenges. The worst part is there not implemented well, the UI takes away from the rest of the game and makes things harder to do like look at states or use chat. Challenges are confusing and point less did I mention confusing. I don‚Äôt think I have actually looked at another players challenges or my challenges progression after a game. The only thing I like are the titles but I don‚Äôt care about them that much and if they were gone I wouldn‚Äôt care.

It is ok to make a system and no have every body use it. In elden ring there was content that you didn‚Äôt find( hell I didn‚Äôt even guard counter and I did use a shield)and that‚Äôs ok. You don‚Äôt need to push a system in peoples faces to get your money‚Äôs worth out of it, this will just lead to actual problems like the game feeling clunky and that can over time make it easier to quit or stop playing‚Ä¶ on second thought I love the new UI keep it up.",1652343811

leagueoflegends,"League MMR System, ELO, and my account","I have been playing LOL since September of 2019. I first played ranked in 2020 and 2021, and finished Bronze and Silver in those two.   
Currently, I am pushing for Gold, and am sitting at 99 wins and 70 losses in Silver 1, 86 LP. In my last 20, I am something like 15-5. However, I only gain 12-14 LP, and lose 16 or more LP per loss. Even after going on a 9 game win streak, my LP gains didn't change and actually decreased to 12 from 15.   
I do not duo, and have mainly been solo queuing. Using a MMR checker, it seems my MMR is Silver 3.  


My question is, is it worth continuing with this account? I have all my skins on it and I am almost level 300. Will my MMR ever catch up and allow me to gain more LP per win? It seems pretty hopeless right now.",1652342422

leagueoflegends,Trolls and bots are becoming more common,"Heyo, here an adc main who was in high bronze last season but had a bad positioning games and went to iron 1. What the fk is this elo. I had NEVER found a bot or a troll in ranked NEVER. I started to try to rank up for leaving iron like 1 month and a half ago, and i dont play a lot of ranked bc of this. Honestly im tired.

This was funny, honestly, and tilting, bc she were trying to ff the whole game and she was like ""im not a bot"" ""this game was lost since you joined the lobby"" ""Just ff"" ""Im not trolling"". She never used an ult on anyone who was not her, she only used shield on me 1 time so idk.

Other time, a bot, spamming ""ELO HELL"" ""HAHA THIS GAME U NOT GONNA GAIN LPS"" and things like those, he literally followed me all the game, recalled at the same time as i did, used summoner spells randomly...

[He didnt die too much bc i noticed the recall bug of the bot and made him recall as much as i could](https://preview.redd.it/q83h76ivxzy81.png?width=454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46aee2d7efb5949af64142f5eea8b896219500d5)

Another one. This game made me literally cry from anxiety, he were stealing farm or making me lose it and then writing on the chat ""kai'sa u are a very bad adc you have no cs"" and ""you cant carry this bc you are useless"" and more things like that.

[I dont wanna remember this xd](https://preview.redd.it/zz6ijlbdyzy81.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0277e0b38b3537cdfc4d6f5a1536604570b2c546)

leagueoflegends,What would make JG way more tolerable and even enjoyable is if the minimap wasn't allowed to be so small,"The minimap shouldn't be allowed to be small. Set it to at minimum to what 90/100 is right now.

Because as things are right now the role being called ""jungle"" is misleading. It should be called ""ping spammer to get team's attention"". Right now that is 1 of the biggest factors to be a good jungler is you have to spam ping a LOT in order to get your team's attention.

It should be you just need to ping omw twice within 5 seconds of arriving to a gank. But that doesn't get people's attention, they're just so out of it you have to spam ping non-stop missing ping for 10+ seconds for your team to get the idea that you're coming for a gank. 

Teammates don't look at the minimap at all, however if it was set to be much bigger that would make it easier for people to be aware of the minimap. Is that not what we want?

Even without needing to spam ping a million times per game playing jungle already feels like a job. Add having to spam ping and jungle becomes borderline untolerable.",1652340361

leagueoflegends,This champion is getting the biggest buff on patch 12.10 and here's why,"This might be surprising, but **Senna is getting the biggest buff in patch 12.10**
Why Senna for this patch? 

Increased durability on all champions. Senna is one of the MOST benefitted champions of this change. Why?

-She has some of the lowest defense stats in the game. Meaning she is actually getting one of the biggest buffs in the game, the lower your base stats, the more % a flat increase across all champions is for your character.

-She has built in healing. Healing goes hand in hand with durability. As the more health (or EHP) you have, the more your effective your healing is AND the more chance you survive until your next chance to use your next healing ability.

-The final reason, on top of those other 2 HUGE increases, is since we are going into a possibly later game scenario (scaling champions are broken) well the mother of all scaling supports, Senna, is here. 


Everyone is getting buffed, but man Senna is getting buffed most of all.

You can build her however you want. But here is the build I will use and some tricks I use that I never hear people talk about to get ahead early. 

Runes: **Lethal Tempo**- you'd be surprised how easy it is for Senna to build this up once mid game team fights start breaking out (and even easier after everyone's durability is higher and teamfights last longer) 

**Legend Attack Speed**
**Coup De Grace or Cut Down**


**Slightly Magical Boots** and **APPROACH VELOCITY**. Approach Velocity is insane on Senna. Her basic attacks already slow AND provide movement speed to her so this rune automatically gets use off every basic attack, this rune is very under utilized. The Magic Boots are pretty good since you are trying to play for scaling. Biscuits could be an option but the other 2 runes are slightly more useful in my opinion. Try them out.

lvl 1: Sickle + potions
first item if you can: Kircheis Shard for 700 gold your Q will do 80 damage. Thats WAY more than sheen does and lots of people rush sheen. Senna is actually one of the only characters who can do this. Because what other Ranged character sits in lane, not attacking minions, meaning, not keeping their energized attack off cooldown and ready to poke

After this

Kraken Slayer -&gt; Rapidfire Cannon -&gt; Bork -&gt; LDR/BT/IE/Guardian Angel/Maw/Wits End/Black Cleaver

Whats really underused here is the Bork. Senna is actually really good at using it, she loves the movement speed, she loves the on hit damage

Black Cleaver and wits end also give move speed with attacks but you'd be surprised how great you can chase with Bork. 


The Divine Sunderer and Lethality builds may still be good but they don't scale like this attack speed Senna. And if it really is a scaling meta then you better believe this build gives her exactly what she needs.

Focus on getting quick AA-&gt;Q combo in lane to get a quick soul off an enemy and a quick 40 gold from your support item and grabbing the souls whenever they drop so you can scale into the mid game.",1652340219

leagueoflegends,ARAM Wins Not Retroactively Tracked,"Apparently the challenges won't track your wins in ARAM, so you're essentially starting from scratch.

I've been playing League for the last decade of my life and to see that something like this isn't going to be tracked by a highly requested feature for years is just disappointing.

I really want to love these challenges, but there are so many things that I've done over the years that I probably will never be able to recreate. To not be able to do something as basic as tracking wins or even games played in the collection when in the endgame screen it says the exact amount of wins and losses is just lame.

This feels the same as when they added the levels, I'd be well over my current level if they raised the level cap earlier. I'd probably have 200k at least on Fizz as well before his rework. Sorry for the rant, I'm a little bitter about this lol.

leagueoflegends,My moment of triumph before getting banned,"Got banned off of the r/leagueoflegends discord server because i replied to a moderator  
that was muting channels,people,banning people,etc...",1652337011
leagueoflegends,Got the special treatment from riot,"as known the state of league's community and the toxicity, and how nothing is done about it.. decided to observe it a while suspecting  biased actions and suspensions and yes shortly they are.. against certain ethnics,beliefs and cultures it goes okay be toxic as much as you want against them... also some words and some behaviors... but some other things even if you talk about them you actually get banned   


anyway i decided to try to see how far league would go 

so apparently offensive names get forced to change their names once they are caught ""that's if the game does care"" 

and super offensive names from what i searched get banned for a week 

because of my name i got 2 weeks ban 

i reported a lot of people that were highly offensive for different things but they were never banned.

&amp;#x200B;

so with the great fairness of this game, did you get banned for that period for a name before? what was it",1652336927
leagueoflegends,The new update is working perfectly with no bugs,"So I just won a game and riot decided to give me +7lp with a loss prevented banner... when I won the game, they gave me a loss prevented. 

Anyone else finding this new update buggy, low quality, and rushed out when it was not ready for live servers?

leagueoflegends,My Love/Hate Relationship For This Game Grows.,"I was feeling iffy, insomnia wasn't doing any favors, so I decided to play some league to grind to S1 / G4, but of course the servers as well as the client had to go batshit crazy this morning, causing a whole plethora of issues from my main champions in champ select vanishing, fog of war just not working, games disconnecting for some and being fine for others (resulting in an unfair match that STILL GETS COUNTED), games just not registering as ever being played or existing, and skins that were bought or rerolled simply disappearing. 

I thought it was just me, so I switched accounts but no, after seeing the plethora of complaints elsewhere along with ranked queues finally being disabled (I doubt proper compensation will be given out to a whole region) I now wish it really was just on my end. 

I still enjoy playing, but it's not really the same feeling I got when playing years ago. It just feels like things are getting worse. Even when it doesn't feel like that, it's just not a pleasant experience majority of the time, and when it isn't I obviously do something else like draw. I remember when I used to get excited getting out of Bronze 5 or reaching Silver, etc. Now it's just a ""oh neat, finally"" feeling

I love playing this game, but the constant changes to champions I used to love, the disregard for others due to them not selling enough shit or being more in the potential new-coming players' eye, the abundance of people that exist solely to make games worse or try \*just enough\* to avoid punishment, and watching the client degrade from something with minor issues that happen every so often to major issues that happen every new champion or feature (just to name a few) is just... tiring. 

I still enjoy playing, but it's not really the same feeling I got when playing years ago. It just feels like things are getting worse. Even when it doesn't feel like that, it's just not a pleasant experience majority of the time, and when it isn't I obviously do something else like draw. I remember when I used to get excited getting out of Bronze 5 or reaching Silver, etc. Now it's just a ""oh neat, finally"" feeling.

Needless to say, my ranked grind went terrible tonight. I'll try again later when I have the tolerance to sit through more toxic behavior, muted chat/pings, people who legit run it down, or just a typical 30 minute back and forth game of league. 

The post-game stuff looks cool though.

That's all, I'm just ranting.",1652336789

leagueoflegends,Why I Think League of Legends is at it's best recently,"I always thought the pace of the game was way too fast. I couldn't collect my thoughts and felt like the learning curve was insurmountable. With this recent patch, the game has SIGNIFICANTLY slowed down. I feel much more comfortable learning at this pace. It took me 5 minutes to walk to lane. With this feature, I was able to admire every possible escape route along the way. Now I'm learning - now we're getting somewhere.

Sometimes, I feel like I could practice CSing better if there wasn't a opponent laner distracting me. After the recent patch, Riot did me the favor of stopping my enemy laner from spawning in. Now I could - slowly - get my csing down to a T. However, Riot kept my humble with random lag spikes between CSing, reminding me in a much more comfortable way that my CSing was still bad. This is good for training!

Finally, I always felt so sad when I saw my towers and inhibitors fall. I'd rather hear it from the soothing voice of the summoner's rift goddess. Now, I can't see anything happening, but I can hear the rift announcer tell me with that calming voice that all my structures are falling by the couple of demigods graced with good connection that game.

Everything about this experience is better. Everyone keeps complaining about how bad the game is now, calling it ""laggy"". I'm glad those posts are getting removed, because they're liars. The game has never been better! Thank you Rito Gamez.",1652334794

leagueoflegends,Does Riot have any UX designers working on the client?,"With each update the user experience and readability of information seems to become worse. I understand there are technical difficulties related to resolving all the client issues but this is a completely different can of worms. I have been working in the software industry for around 9 years and I genuinely believe that any UI/UX designer from any company I worked for, including small startups, would do a better job in most of the client's areas.  


The fact that things like the missions story dialogue where you had to click 20 times to progress after every mission and now the convoluted and arbitrary values of the new challenges system, new post game screen (why can I only see 3 lines of chat at a time?), and non-centered challenges tokens in loading screen that basically overlap with the titles all made it to production makes me seriously doubt their internal user experience testing.

I'll never understand why Riot is so quick to gut other common pro play picks when they overperform such as Azir, Ryze, Qiyanna, Akali, Zeri, Aphelios and others but seem to completely ignore her existence.

In not particular order for me:

1. Pulsefire Caitlyn

Autos on this skin are so incredibly smooth, the model is very well done, it has a nice chroma, and the gun appearance and sound effects are really cool.

2. Battle Academia Ezreal

I think this is a pretty underrated skin as I rarely see it get used. His abilities look unique with an almost neon red/blue glow to them. Really good voice lines with lots of anime tropes.

3. Star Guardian Xayah

Another one I think is a bit underrated. The model and chromas are very well done. Smooth autos and abilities. Can't really play Xayah with any other skin since I like her autos and feathers on this one so much.

4. Sentinel Irelia

This is pretty much the only good thing that came out of that disaster of a Sentinel event from a year ago. Abilities are clean as hell and the splash art is gorgeous.

5. Star Guardian Ahri

This was one of the first legendary skins I ever owned and still one of my favorites. The voice lines are actually pretty clever, has smooth autos and abilities. I usually prefer using this over Spirit Blossom which I know is probably an unpopular opinion.

Now you can all proceed to call me a weeb or RP whore since I have multiple SG skins and a BA skin on my list and 4/5 are legendary.",1652326709

leagueoflegends,Message after Bot match disruptive behavior detected?,"I just played a singled bot(AI) match and there was in no way, shape, or form any toxicity from anyone in the game.

The message said something like ""Disruptive behavior detected so challenge progress is impacted"". I should have screenshotted it! It popped up before the endgame lobby so I'm certain no one reported anyone. 

I'm just kinda like woah it didnt even tell me what it thought was disruptive? I was playing 2 top and was just having fun, lane partner was slaying. Bots seemed to be smarter since update so I was just kinda feelin' em out. I ended 3/4/14 but did significantly lower damage than everyone else because I kept getting smashed by a double heal top with a dps partner lol

So again this was A BOT MATCH. I'm gonna take a break from league for a bit because I'm not trying to get my account fucked up over some weird new automated system that sends you super vague notifications! Ohwell! :(",1652323227

It'd feel pretty damn cool to unlock 95% of the challenges instantly, and it'd show how devoted you are to this game, I agree, but it'll get old Very Very fast, and I doubt you'd want to even open the challenges window again.

leagueoflegends,Isn't it time to let Damage/Tank supports have a turn?,"Now, I'll admit, as a Taric/Janna play I may be biased to tank-heavy support meta's... but I feel like we've been in an enchanter meta for a long time now.

&amp;#x200B;

While I understand that 2018-2020 was pretty much a non-stop engage meta, at this point it's been an enchanter meta for nearly as long as it was a tank meta. I just feel like we've had a lack of tank supports in solo queue for quite a while. I definitely think that IDEALLY there should be a place for damage, tank, and enchanter supports, generally one is always going to be somewhat better than the others.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, the meta MAY shift towards tank supports after the durability update (I don't think it will, longer fights mean more time to proc ardent, moonstone, easier redemptions, more chances to heal, more changes to buff, more chances to hit impactful stuns, and an easier time using ""slow"" defensive ults like Taric/Janna R), but assuming that it won't, I feel like it may be time to test out some changes.

leagueoflegends,What has been done to you League of Legends,"**This is a letter of relief from a player who has been playing LoL for a long time and really wants it to go back to the way it used to be**

I am honestly quite disappointed with the actions of Riot games in recent years regarding the development of Legue of legend, first they removed the rotating game modes such as ascension destroy the nexus, nexus blitz and only left the most famous ones like URF and One For all, then they removed twisted forest and this was what hurt me the most because it was a third option to play LoL because if you did not want to play rift because it took too long or aram because it is full of people quite tryhard there was the middle ground which was twisted forest which was a short map but with jungle as it would be summoner rift, then came the champs with kits about exploits with stupid skills like Viego, Akali (rework), Zoe, Aphelios, after that the disastrous client which to this day is still a piece of garbage since bugs are found every damn day but for Riot games ""The client is in good shape""  [(7) Riot: ""Client is in good shape"". Do you agree? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPXlqCN1Z8A)  (take riot absorb this knowledge please admire the community response), the changes to the chests and the mythic essence for god what a horrible change just to try to get more money, that's not bad but don't do it by going to a system that you yourself put in place a friend of mine had been saving gems for 1 whole year to buy his Chogat skin and now he can't even buy it because the store changes every too many patches and talking about things that spend too much time the battle passes are crap it can't be that you pay 25 dollars for a battle pass that even playing too many games for days only gives you for the final reward and nothing else, when if you buy something like a pass is to farm but not to die trying I couldn't even open an orb since I wanted the Pyke skin with his chroma and playing 10-15 games of Aram and Summoner's Rift I barely made it for the skin because I had to buy a chest to get there since I ran out of time.  

I'm not saying that you go back in time but at least have the interest of wanting to improve, because the only thing I see in every patch is that you only care about the money you earn and if you listen to the community is for something that can benefit you economically and not for something that can improve the game such as removing from your API the fact that they can know if someone on your team is autofill because it gives too much advantage to the opposing team because they can focus you and play safer knowing that your jungler is autofill and theirs is not, this is just an example but it is understood that it is too much advantage and only makes the games heavier because having an autofill is a disadvantage and on top of that the enemy team knows that disadvantage and knowing that they can exploit it is horrible and this is just an example of how much they could improve it would also be great to fix the client or at least some of its most annoying bugs and do not make me talk about the bugs of the champions because I would be here for days.  


**I'm sorry if you die reading this and I really don't speak English and I think you can tell and I'm originally from Argentina and I came here just so that at least my words hopefully will be read by someone from the riot games team because for Riot Latin America doesn't exist.**",1652315626

Blind pick is 100% broken, there is absolutely no way for anyone to debate this, I have been grouped with gold-plat non-stop from lvls 15-25. 

I mean, these people are level 300+.

I have to start asking myself what is going on, every other match I get 2 teammates scrapping over a lane, or someone who just roams around like a bot, while the other team is getting ranked players already.

I am also noticing a trend of what is clearly high rank players getting matched with me, and sometimes trolling themselves.

leagueoflegends,Won less lp than stated,"So basically, I had dodged a previous ranked game because my toplaner decided to ban my champ knowing I was picking it.

leagueoflegends,Noticed a lore detail,"So I was looking back at the Sentinels of Light event recently, and noticed something odd about the map, specifically about the area you can't go between Noxus and Demacia. It's an area unclaimed by any region and if you know anything about Noxus, it's weird that they expanded out to sea instead of towards Demacia further inland. Thankfully, there is one single champion who provides an explaination; Kled.

In Kled's original lore story to accompany his release, he fought off invasions from both sides of ""his land"" against both Noxus and Demacia. Obviously Kled's land can't move, and there is only one place where they could reasonably go to meet with Kled in the middle, and this is that. This isn't anything new, I've heard people saying this for years and while it's technically never been confirmed... I don't know what other reason there could be for this land to not be claimed.

My point: This map shows every area of Valoran that was being covered in Black Mist. The only exception is Kled's land. This means that Viego was willing to climb mount Targon and fight an aspect that survived death through sheer mortal willpower, but the drunk yordle with a shotgun?

He's a psychopathic tyrant, not an idiot.

leagueoflegends,Immature topic: Fan reactions to ships being teased. Help me understand,"First  of all I want to clarify that I have nothing againts homosexuality or  anything like that. If it makes you happy is okay, I couldn't care less  if someone likes the same gender, good for them. This is a silly first  world immature topic from my part I know.

I  want to touch this topic in a respectful way without really trying to  offend anybody, If I do is by accident and I apologize for my ignorance

I'm  just curious, when Leona and Diana were teased the communty went wild  (which is good happy for them) now with TF and Graves there is all this  positivity (again good for the gay men that wanted representation and  shipped them).

But here is the  problem, when riot teases something straight like Kayle/Aatrox,  Lux/Ezreal, Kayn/Akali or Syndra/Zed, on other universes (or anything  straight that isn't xayah/rakan) people get wild but mad. Why? Again I'm  not trying to be offensive or victimize, just to understand.

Someone  teases ekko/ezreal on the pulsefire universe and people adores it, if  it is your think I'm happy for you, twitter loves it but try to ship 2  characters of different gender and you get mocked, attacked or just  flooded with negativity. People openly point out things are bad for  being straight, the writers on twitter have to apologize or rectify say  things aren't romantic.

It is cool  to see gay representation and ships but (at least on my experience) is  the negativity towards straight ships needed? Try to ship something like  zed and syndra on twitter and you get crucified, try to say you don't  ship zed and shen or Syndra and Irelia and you are automatically a  homophobe (nothing againts the ships), when in reality you are just  trying to have fun?

If I see  someone hating things for being gay I think they are biggots and that  everybody has the right to love what they love but that is true for  straight stuff too.

I'm not gay  but the few gay people I know are great people which I appreciate and  respect and they do the same to me. That's why I don't understand the  negativity towards these little things, the obsessive hate some people  have for these little things like shipping, seriously, just look on  twitter when something gay or straight is teased and the reaction is  completely different.

Again I'm  happy gay things are being done, in fact we need more, I just wish the  same happiness were true for some of my straight ships.

Again it is no my intention to offend, if I do I apologize. I have nothing againts lgbtq+ things, I'm just trying to understand.",1652307883

leagueoflegends,My opinion of the current state of the game as a returning player,"Hello, I used to play this game a lot and quit. For context, I am a mid main who enjoys playing mages. I came back to the game recently and here's what I noticed. 

It used to be the case that when we choose who to play, we choose the champion based on their abilities but now, we choose the champion based on the items. Now we just go like ""I want to play a maw of malmortius champion in the mid lane"" instead of ""I want to play Qiyana.""

I am not a fan of how this works because it seems to me that champion identity isn't so important anymore - which is why I liked to play this game in the first place. For example, I was Zoe in a game and I was way ahead. I had luden's, sorc pen boots, a full mejais, lich bane, deathcap, void staff. I was 1v1 a Qiyana with just claw, yoomu's, and maw. I threw my full combo on her, I cannot kill her. She throws her full combo on me, I was dead. If I was this ahead, I should be able to kill her as a BURST MAGE. But no, champion identity doesn't matter anymore. The point is, it seems to me that the game wants people to choose champion based on what items they build because the items are so op.

Look at Maokai, he is such a sad champion to play now because his items are not op. Champion's kits just don't matter anymore. Personally in my opinion there is nothing fun about playing items, I'd like to play the champions again.",1652304987

leagueoflegends,First Strike can be removed and the game will be objectively more balanced,"Kleptomancy was annoying, Omnistone sucked, and First Strike is cancer. Riot has been trying to fit a square into a round hole for 4 years with this playstyle and it has not worked.

Every First Strike user already had a perfect keystone. Gangplank went Grasp, Talon went Electrocute, Lux went Comet, etc. They've all dumped it immediately because this thing is broken.

Now here's where we get to the balanced part. Currently out of the 5 rune trees, all have 4 except Domination.
- Move Aery to Inspiration. I don't think anyone would have a problem with this, it seems an innate Support rune
- Move Dark Harvest to Sorcery. This will get more feedback, but when you think of it most of the champs running this aren't even Assassins. Karthus, Veigar, Brand, Annie, Jhin, etc.

Now all the trees are balanced with 3 keystones and First Strike is dead good riddance.",1652304902

Does anyone else do this? 1. See league content 2. Decide to play 3. immediately encounter reasons why you didn't want to play league (leavers, afk, trolling, toxicity, etc) 4. close game and do something else?

IDK why I like this game or even play it occasionally anymore. It feels like a lot of the time I like the idea of it more than the actual content, I enjoy strategy games in general, and I enjoy team games and being competitive, but it often feels like I'm at the mercy of others for my experience to be good. Someone is having a bad day so now we all are. I sometimes feel like if this game was somehow 1v1 I'd be infinitely more rewarded and able to spam it. 

Yet, even though this cycle always hits me, I still play it. Is the moba niche just tickling another one of my fancies? Am I just tired of it? It's depressing to me that I have so many hours in this game, but when I put so many hours into a game like Slay the Spire I feel personal accomplishment for beating it at its hardest modes or learning it in and out. This game feels like a chore for me and a ""Default"" game that I go to when I want to play something fun, only to realize it's really not.

leagueoflegends,Story about Inting Master Yi Strategy,"So I have a story to share.

I just played a game and our midlaner checked stats of our teammates and concluded that the game was not winnable. He said that I was ""inting"" on Jayce in the last few games, which might not be a completely false statement. Moreove he said that our support has a winrate of 39% and therefore concluded that the game was not winnable.

&amp;#x200B;

He picked Master Yi midlane with smite and cleanse and said we should check his [op.gg](https://op.gg), where we can see that he has 4% winrate on Master Yi in 27 Games. No one in our team wanted to dodge so the game started.

&amp;#x200B;

In Game I solo killed top and Bot lane was leading in kills 3 to 2 while he already died once and was just running around tilting our jungler by taking camps etc.

&amp;#x200B;

After 15 Minutes (Game was not really winnable) we wanted to ff because we played 4 v 5 and had no chance. He hold us hostage and pressed no. He actually typed and admitted to hold us hostage until 20 mins or nexus goes down.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the absurd part begins. After the game I actually checked his match history and in the 3 days he had 4 Master Yi games with smite cleanse, showing that he does this frequently. I have no clue how he is not banned yet because I am sure multiple ppl reported him and its a clear case of hostage holding/saboutage.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not going to disclose either his ingame name or mine so he does not get abused, but has anyone had similar experiences where you feel like the player should have been banned long before?",1652301086

leagueoflegends,"On the alternative ""solutions"" of MSI","**Summary**

At this point, we all know the controversy of MSI. In brief, because the LPL representatives RNG are locked down with no mobility, they cannot be present in Busan. As such, the current decision Riot has made is to have all participants play on a fixed ping. Disadvantages of this scheme are that it is 1) hard to balance and control for the asymmetry between the environment in Shanghai and Busan 2) Pro players historically practice for stage games on low ping for the most part 3) The meta may be significantly different on low ping vs 30ms.

**Involved Parties**

1) The players: I'm sure every player, including those on RNG, wish the entire tournament was played on LAN. The numerous complaints by them on this current fiasco is evidence.

2) Riot: They want this event to go on and ideally break even.

3) LPL: From what I've heard (sources questionable), they are relatively indifferent about the event, if not leaning towards not attending in the first place. RNG in particular is under extreme lockdown, making it infeasible for attending personally.

**Potential ""Solutions""**

1) **The LPL doesn't show up.** This is problematic as we significantly cut an overwhelmingly large fraction of the viewerbase. You cannot force these viewers to care enough to watch a tournament without any team to root for. This may be surprising for a lot of us in the West with very few teams that are world-class, and therefore we are more likely to look outside our own countries and root for foreign teams, but for Chinese fans, most of them will not watch a tournament without significant representation. 

Potential counterarguments:

* **So? Why care about the loss of viewership? Competitive integrity is more important.** I don't have inside knowledge, but I'm pretty sure the tournament would be a financial disaster for Riot to host. If such a thing were to happen, who would foot the bill? Maybe they cut a lot of skins for unpopular champions they had planned? Maybe they cut Arcane 2? How much would need to be sacrificed to foot such a large bill?
* **Ask Tencent to cover the bill?** Good luck on convincing a large company that makes an insignificant fraction of their revenue from League in investing the resources for an event with pretty much no returns for investment.
* **Why not minimize the loss as much as possible?** We'd need to know the details of how much each thing costs on the balance sheet. How much would the event cost if there was no live audience and venue bookings, no hype videos, etc.? Would the teams be okay with significantly decreasing the prize pool? Would advertisers back out from a plain event? Some of these decisions made previously are likely irreversible. I'd be willing to bet that even if Riot cut every extraneous thing, the cost would still be too high for them to put up with.

2) **Cancel MSI.** I think that despite what some people claim on Reddit, that a large silent majority would rather there be an event or nothing at all. Or at least, a large number of people who regardless on the opinion of whether MSI should continue or not would still watch the event with all its flaws. Even if they cancelled it now, there's probably already a large cost present to having started the event, which brings up the question of who foots the bill as well. 

3) **Have the LPL play on 30ms and everyone else plays on LAN.** I don't see any of the top LPL teams who would be willing to play at this disadvantage. Imagine getting humiliated by a clearly weaker team by getting ""outplayed"". Some of their fans would probably turn on them. The more reasonable fans would probably not watch a ""rigged"" tournament which brings up the same issues as mentioned previously. Fans of successful regions are ruthless. I don't know if anyone remembers when RNG lost to G2 back when they were the favorites, but the backlash was insane and if IG did not win the whole thing...

Potential counterarguments:

* **Why not force the LPL team to play subjected to unequal ping?** The question is, how? I'd be willing to bet that the LPL is willing to give up its fourth worlds spot this year to not attend. If you put in higher punishments, you risk angering the entire viewerbase which not only affects this event, but subsequent ones. Also, what higher punishment can you incur? If LPL doesn't show up to MSI, they lose the privilege of attending worlds? Now worlds is an infeasible event. Subject the LPL to fines or make them foot the bill if they don't agree? Should this happen, the playerbase will protest, and arguably rightfully so. Is it fair to punish a region that supposedly voted overwhelmingly not to go in the first place and only decided to participate to make the event feasible? Also, the LPL is fully capable of standing by itself without ever attending international events. It's like the NBA. 
* **There's got to be a team willing to play in such conditions**. Yes there probably is, but I doubt it'd be one of the top ones. Imagine if any other region sent their bottom-of-the-pack or mediocre team. I honestly would still watch, but I could not say that about most of the viewerbase. 

4) **Have LPL play against every other team at 30ms, and every other game is on LAN.** I think this is clear from previous posts, but practicing for two different environments is probably infeasible for most of the teams.

5) **Do 4) but make all LPL games exhibition matches that don't contribute to anything.** I personally think this is probably an ok alternative solution. However, I don't know how much this would affect viewership. Would fans care to watch if their team's wins and losses don't matter? I'm not sure. Also, how would knockouts work assuming the LPL team advances? 

**Conclusion**

All-in-all, I agree that there are large flaws with the current solution. However, I don't see how any of the other solutions are better enough to merit changing the format at such a late stage. I think the unfair portrayal of Riot being a greedy capitalist company is egregiously unfair: it was only recently after all that these international events broke even and became profitable. I do, however, agree in the need for the execution of the current solution to be a lot better.",1652300584

leagueoflegends,Why does support always go bot lane?,"I‚Äôm curious why support always goes bot lane with the adc. I get that some supports roam and whatnot but I never see the support playing mid or top lane.

It seems like the lane support goes should be matchup specific.",1652299395

leagueoflegends,How do you find the PBE gameplay so far from the Durability Changes? Any surprises? A space for discussion.,"I figured since these changes are so big, maybe we could hold a discussion thread here about how the PBE gameplay ACTUALLY feels. We've seen TONS of discussion so far about these changes, with people speculating how they will pan out. So I hope this discussion thread can be a place for people to actually talk about how the Durability Changes and Damage reduction to overall League gameplay experience FEEL. 

Some discussion ideas:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do each of the classes feel? Any dead? Any surprising life? 
2. Does burst feel much more balanced now? Are you able to play the game with more intentionality than before? 
3. How do sustain builds feel? 
4. Any surprising changes in viability of champs, in your view? 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope the mods can take this idea and maybe even make their own stick post for it. The Durability changes are basically a massive pre-season level change, so there should be plenty of discussion about them as they're tested on the PBE.",1652299363
