Administrate,The best job I've ever had,5.0,"I've worked in several jobs over the past twenty years, in various industries; all SaaS or IT-service related.  Without a doubt, Administrate is the most enjoyable job I've had in that time; the people, culture, pace and attitude all adds up to be the perfect combination.

The company truly believes in, and acts according to its values; when I was applying here, and learned about ""the values"", to my British ears is sounded corny, but seeing it in action, it just feels natural; it's rare to have a work conversation where someone doesn't mention one of them.

We have a four-day working week and some flexible working, which really helps with childcare; a really sustainable work-life balance.

All departments are very responsible to our customers, but without losing sight of the long-term strategic goals.  It's fast paced and challenging, but tremendously good fun, too.

We have an in-house therapist and life-coach who can offer mental health support when needed - it's all part of us being ""The Ultimate Human Organisation""

Leadership is transparent, accountable and approachable. The company works towards outcomes and it feels as though we are genuinely empowered to take ownership of those. 

There's plenty of scope to own and drive change (one of the company's values) as an individual or as a team, and plenty of support when you do. 

Culturally, it's expected that work can and should be completable within normal hours. My days are full of challenging work, but I don't work into the evenings and definitely not at weekends (I even got warned to log off Slack and relax once!) 

It's a brilliant place to work if you're a proactive, mission-driven person who wants to solve challenging problems.

Abstract,"Great people, Fun environment!",5.0,"The whole company, including much of the leadership team, went through a huge transition shortly before I joined the company. A lot of the people I work with were hired in the past year.

It seems like there was a lot of ambiguity before I joined (and we still have some) - but the leadership team has done a great job of providing clear direction while listening to feedback and weighing all the options and opinions from everyone here. 

The environment is laid back for a startup. There's a huge focus on work life balance and taking time self-care. 

Leadership has done a great job of creating a remote-first company culture, incorporating a variety of ways to get to know each other, and space for families to join sometimes. 

This group does a lot more to be actively inclusive and check themselves than many places I've been. People I work with actively think about the phrasing they use in conversation - and not just when there is someone who seems 'diverse' present. Our CEO makes a point to call out bias and unhealthy culture when she sees it (including when it comes from herself).

Unlimited vacation, and a team actively working to figure out what benefits we all feel like we need.

- No visions from the execs, nobody really knows what to work on (it's been like this since February), and it seems that it will continue this way until September / EOY.
- D&I is not a thing anymore and according to the execs, D&I is a luxury for companies that can afford it.
- Since the pre-COVID layoff all the management and execs left. This led to several bad actors playing politics and lying their way to the top, trying to get promotions and raises by messing up with the company's culture, and stabbing their coworkers in the back.
- Since February, we haven't had a single week without bad news. The exec team tells us not to worry, and then double down on the bad news.
- This is yet another company where people don't get what they deserved and opportunities are not given based on skills and track records but on who you're friend with, and how hard you are willing to fight. Many skilled people got promotions by being forced to say ""either I get one or I leave"".

Abstract,Just Another Struggling Startup Exploiting Diversity to Inflate Brand,2.0,"Coworkers: The majority of my co-workers are kind and talented and I‚Äôve enjoyed working with most of my peers. Management (not exec level, but engineering managers) also does their best to protect their employees.

Flexibility: The company is remote first and you can get paid Bay Area salaries, without being stuck in the Bay. You can definitely set your own hours as long as you communicate well.

Refocused Vision: Interim execs are forcing the company to focus on actually delivering what customers have been asking for and the engineering team is doing great work to try to deliver a customer-focused product.","Diversity: The company claims they are making history in both design and diversity/inclusion/belonging. There were many blog posts and presentations broadcasting this brand both internally and externally. However, when revenue didn‚Äôt scale with the number of employees they had hired and the leadership had their first chance to prove that they actually meant what Abstract‚Äôs slogan said - Good Intentions are Not Enough - they folded. People of color were strongly overrepresented in those who were laid off. After leadership said their would be no more layoffs, they quietly laid off the remaining members of the People team. Diversity or inclusion hasn‚Äôt been mentioned once since the layoffs - when an employee asked an anonymous question about the overrepresentation in an AMA w/ the interim CEO, the interim CEO and engineering leadership attempted to coerce that the person who asked into talking directly to HR, and simply said ‚Äúnothing has changed with respect to our emphasis on diversity‚Äù. That‚Äôs clearly not true, and nothing has changed since layoffs - instead of continuing to grow our diverse workforce, jobs have been outsourced to contractors. Additionally, engineering leaders have said approximately ‚Äúwe have trouble hiring women, but we don‚Äôt want to lower the bar‚Äù - Abstract is not immune to patterns of sexism and racism, and while they are common in tech, they are antithetical to Abstract‚Äôs internal and external diversity claims. 

Engineering Culture: Struggles to improve the software‚Äôs performance are met with more and more micromanaging and micro-analyzing of engineer performance, instead of leadership taking a step back and realizing that the struggles have more to do with an unclear vision and constantly shifting team structure. Trust has degraded between leadership and engineers - for example, individualized metrics (# of coding days, commits per day, etc) were introduced 1 week before performance reviews started, but were still used in performance discussions. Leadership often repeats their ‚Äúfall in line or get out of my way‚Äù mentality and are expecting 10x coders at all levels - even more so during this pandemic. 

Remote Culture: Abstract is ‚Äúremote first‚Äù and not all-remote (there is a Gitlab blog about the term all-remote that is worth reading). There is a location hierarchy (those who can be in the SF office at the top) and exec leadership is disconnected from what remote work/communication/collaboration is like because they can preferentially meet in person at the office. Leadership lacks vision to push a more collaborative and inclusive remote culture (and also laid off their Director of Culture), therefore public Slack channels are almost silent; a message or two a day will make regular work days feel like you‚Äôre working on a weekend/holiday or at a company without coworkers.

Product: The actual product is extremely buggy and slow. Designers strongly dislike working in the current version of the software daily and it is going to take a lot of work to turn the reputation around. 

TLDR: There is nothing special about this company‚Äôs culture anymore and the values ring hollow after the deafening silence around the layoffs. It‚Äôs just like any other struggling startup in the Valley, probably better to look elsewhere.",30 Apr 2020 - Software Engineer

Excellent pay and solid benefits","The founders have no idea how to lead and are a constant roadblock

One co-founder, in particular, is more concerned with being friends with employees that he has blinders and fails to lead, act or execute

The founders are obsessed with being kind which translates to being overly emotional and tolerant of behaviors that go against the core values

Extremely toxic environment due to lack of leadership and favoritism

The executive team are inexperienced and biased and are often the root of confusion and drama

Diversity and inclusion was said to be a priority yet the majority of people of color have been terminated. The website is inaccurate, outdated and misleading 

Many are unhappy with the new direction or leadership changes

It says something when many of the former employees response to being laid off was relief that they could continue their job search openly without having to be discrete. The writing has been on the wall for months now and with new leadership people will continue to leave this company behind

Extremely low morale and low trust of leadership both old and new but many were are least hopeful with the former CEO

Interim leader is very robotic and lacks the compassion and warmth that resonated with employees with the previous leader

Awin,Paradise for older people nearing retirement; bureaucracy hell; politics over results,2.0,"If you're about to retire, want a ""german dream"" kinda job, quiet, pointless, but safe, with a bunch of benefits and a retirement plan, if you enjoy playing politics more than actually doing your job, if you love drowning in bureaucracy, if you enjoy masochism in form of HR ignoring your emails (with follow-ups) for months (!), if it's important for you to have a massage at work, drink some (sometimes) free drinks and do *anything* to avoid work, especially if you prefer to pretend working instead of doing actual work - this is a PERFECT place for you!

Irony aside, there are/were some good things: corporate parties (aspen) with travels to other countries, some good people and amazing colleagues, real professionals who can teach you something, not only something related to work. It's a shame that awin doesn't value that much highly motivated, hard working and professional people.","They pretend to be inclusive. Indeed, there are people from all over the world, of different sexual orientations, young and old working there. They have slideshow kind of trainings, with questionary at the end, basically giving idea of what is right or wrong at the workplace, what is sexual and other kind of abuse at work etc.

At the same time, they discriminate based on age. A quote from one of my managers, which have changed quite frequently: ""you're still young"". This was used as an argumentation not to discuss pay raise, or even creating a plan what I need to do to achieve it. In some departments, I had observed cases of bullying and psychological pressure over the years, possibly also related to age discrimination: older people are being joked about (behind their backs), younger are being denied their ""seniority"".

Talking about the raise... They believe, it seems, in some kind of socialism: everyone should get more or less the same pay on similar positions. The problem is, when someone outperforms their colleagues, they don't get rewarded for that. Meanwhile, others can ""chill"" doing less work or performing with questionable quality, and getting away with the same compensation. Why? Well, one of the reasons, middle management is busy amusing and ""making things look good"" for those ""above"" them, not really caring about those ""below"" them, who at times have to suffer from bad decisions. Most important task is to sell a nice story to their bosses, doesn't matter what it costs to people actually doing work or what it would cost in the future to maintain badly designed solutions.

Another good example of everyday awin hypocrisy: top management declares (2020) ""we're going 4 day working week! Yeehaaa! It's not going to affect your pay or future raises"". At the same time, the moment people asked for a raise, they got replies from their line management something like ""you already got 4 day week, should be enough for you"".

What about hiring contractors with considerably better pay for interesting projects, while senior engineers, who worked for years for this company, have to perform humiliating tasks of copy pasting, cleaning up code after others, and dealing with legacy, all the while being denied a raise? Cherry on top: some of the tech stack engineers have to deal with is still 20 (!!!) years old. Maybe they consider it A WIN, let me just call it ""awin"". 

An ""honorable mention"" deserves a position of Business Partner, part of the HR team. While companies create ""People Partner"" positions instead, with focus on individuals and their needs for benefit of those individuals and consequently the business itself, awin prefers to put accent on ""business"". Business partners side with managers, for whatever reason, instead of even attempting to understand a problem and solve it.

They declare awin to be a tech company, but instead of learning from giants how to create a comfortable atmosphere and environment for engineers and tech people, they will make you fill out excel sheet reports and deal with paperwork, something that could be easily ""outsourced"" to HR or whoever else. Some departments (not talking only about IT/Engineering here) are heavily understaffed, some are lacking automation, performing A LOT of copy-pasting and other manual work. It feels a bit like a startup that expanded and turned into real business, but forgot to evolve. Instead of evolution they brought a bunch of bureaucracy in form of formal meetings, emails, reports and paperwork.

Already your first day *might* start from the fact that the company ""forgot"" to order a laptop or other equipment for you. I'd seen examples when people had to wait for weeks for a replacement too.

Backbone,"Big opportunity, but execution is everything!",5.0,"The product works!

Bringing a consumer product to fruition is immensely complex and riddled with pitfalls. Backbone can and does mitigate some of these challenges. I know this because I work hand in hand with our customers finding unique workflows to help their businesses succeed. Is it for everyone? Nope! But it‚Äôs a unique position to be so close to the end user and thus fulfilling knowing we‚Äôre solving something real. If we go away tomorrow, there a hole‚Ä¶

Over the past 2 years, my tenure with Backbone has been a wild ride. But honestly, that's what I signed up for. While change is hard, it can create opportunities to touch parts of the business you wouldn't have access to in a more mature and siloed organization. I'm confident in Jeff's leadership and excited to see where we can go, even if his profile picture is a bit ominous.

Lastly, given the number of DTC brands, the market and opportunity for Backbone is huge! The question is, can we deliver? I think these past 12 months under Jeff's product guidance and now as our CEO, we're demonstrating we have as good a shot as any!","Like many, we're now fully remote. Which I think takes away from the startup hustle magic that's created in an office. But being a small team, it's an intimate environment. Or at least at the direct team level. We could do more to cross pollinate the functions which to be fair is super hard task for remote companies.

Lastly, our customer base can be a challenge. Our product is more complicated than the messaging, calendar, project management, type SaaS products. Intimately knowing our customers' unique workflows is critical driving Backbone. This means it's not a solution for everyone.",13 Jan 2022 - Director

- Cool city to work from","- Company is insanely wrought with nepotism (leadership team is 90% family and very close friends and the only people to get promoted are these people no matter how valuable another employee might be to the company.) This is not a startup where the best and brightest work - it's where you get a job if you're related to or close buddies with the CEO (therefore this startup is not thriving or destined for startup greatness.) This was a concern of mine when I first joined, though, I went against my better judgement only to be proven that this simply is not good for any company. 

- CEO and the leadership team lacked demonstrated leadership skills OR the ability to hustle as you would expect in ANY early stage company. It was truly disappointing to see in action. Instagram personas are more important to these ""co-founders"" than actually working hard. This is evident by the actual promised product being well over 2 years late. (clients left as a result of this.)

- CEO does not possess the ability to actively listen to anyone. He lacks general authenticity and or the ability to exercise good judgement in running an early stage startup.

leadership had no idea how to properly delegate tasks, manage time or give proper feedback, guidance and training. 

 Being shuffled from one sprint to the next almost without warning, were constantly pulled off of projects halfway through working on them only to be given something totally different, scolded for not following the near non-existent design guidelines and when issues were brought up they were quickly dismissed and nothing changed. Attempts at organizing within our team ended up being pointless due to the aforementioned task hopping.

There was no transparency into the design process whatsoever and anything bad or broken was shoved to the side in favor of cheap, empty pep-talks and ignoring how miserable everyone was for having to pick up the work left behind from that attitude. 

I understand that Backbone is a startup and a lot of the issues can be attributed to a rapidly growing team, juggling multiple tasks and overall just figuring things out, but the way it all was handles and how people got treated during all of that was deeply unfair and unprofessional.",12 Jan 2019 - Anonymous Employee

Bolt‚Äôs ‚ÄòConscious Culture‚Äô manifesto is a shallow marketing gimmick, as fake as the positive reviews that are plastered on this site. In reality, management displays little to none of the values that they claim to espouse. Talk of values and 'putting employees first' are merely window dressing, with the only real interest being to attract investors to act as life support for floundering revenue. 

In terms of senior leadership, the circus of Bolt is led by a cringe-inducing crypto-bro whose manner is more suited to the playground than the boardroom, and a leader on the People side who is no stranger to overseeing toxic environments from their time at a certain bird app. 

When it comes to diversity and inclusion, even by the tech industry‚Äôs abysmally low standards, Bolt‚Äôs gender pay gap is abhorrent - ask about it. On my team, a female colleague was paid nearly 30% less than me for effectively doing the same job.

Boulder County,Best Place I've Ever Worked!!,5.0,"They take great care of their employees here. I've never worked for a place that treats the staff so well. There is little to no drama. Management talks to you like an equal instead of someone beneath them. Even the County Commissioners will stop in the hallway and say hello. It's refreshing to work in a place that actually walk's the talk. Respect is demonstrated each and every day with management and staff alike. I've never been happier in a work environment in my entire life, and working for Boulder County has been a truly rewarding experience. They actually promote from within and invest in the career growth and development of each individual within the organization.","The only con is they don't pay the staff a livable wage for the area. Myself and most of my coworkers live in area's south of Denver and commute up. I did the math and figured out that as an employee starting out in 2017 at an entry level position I earn 35% less than an employee starting out in 1985 did in the same position when inflation is factored in. With the cost of living increasing so drastically, wages need to be increased dramatically if Boulder County intends on recruiting competitively in the current job market. A 2% cost of living raise doesn't go very far when the cost of living goes up 30%. If Boulder County increased their employee pay at the same rate of inflation within the housing market, they'd attract A LOT more quality employees.

And you feel it in the big things, like a team of the kindest, most empathetic and enthusiastic people I've ever met. They want Buffer to succeed and they want YOU to succeed, and you feel it every day. It is a really special feeling, one that I've truly never had before at work and never really expected!

Add to all that the ability to work anywhere in the world; the ability to travel if, when, and as much as you want; unlimited vacation (with a *minimum* of 3 weeks/year); generous salaries; fun and interesting work; progressive family leave; and annual paid-for trips to somewhere awesome in the world (South Africa, Iceland, Hawaii, New York, Sydney, Madrid!) to meet up with the team. It's really a dream job. :D","I ended up falling in love with remote work, but it may not be for everyone. :) Buffer is also fairly experimental and radical, with things like our transparent salary formula and self-management experiment, and that might not be the ideal environment for some.",25 Jan 2017 - Anonymous Employee

I could go on & on about the great salary and perks, which are wonderful, but the reason I love working for Buffer is because within moments of starting, these amazing people felt like family. It's crazy to think how close I've become to a group of people, most of whom I've never met in person.

Throughout my time at Buffer I've expressed interests in different areas of the company, and have always been encouraged to pursue it. Not once have I shared an idea and felt like it wasn't considered seriously. You're not just an employee when you work for Buffer. Every single person at Buffer has the power, the potential, and the platform to shape the future of the company.

Buffer,Buffer is doing it their own way,5.0,"There are a lot of positives of working at this company: the shared values among the team, working remotely, the flexible working environment (build your own!), the flexibility in when you work (timezone differences are effectively a non-issue), but most of all it's the incredibly smart and positive people you get to work with every day. 

Buffer does things their own way. It's unconventional and working hard to do the right thing for their customers and their employees with equal weight. While there's a lot expected out of the team, at the same time the leadership and company genuinely, truly and deeply care about the happiness and fulfillment of each team member. It's an understatement to say this place is special. 

Further, everything happens completely transparently: revenue, salaries and even email are all transparent at Buffer, which is truly amazing. I can't imagine it any other way now.","Sometimes marching to the beat of your own drum results in mistakes of inexperience. Poor financial forecasting led to some layoffs, which shook some confidence in the team. Doing things differently also means experimenting - a lot - with different ways of running and managing the company.

Our 10 values (things like ""choose positivity"", ""show gratitude"", ""live smarter not harder"", ""do the right thing"", ""default to transparency"") are what attracted me to working here, and they are apparent every single day!

Most unique is that our whole team is distributed around the world, and everyone works remotely - there are no offices! We're encouraged to work where we are the happiest, which I am so grateful for. 

The team is so fun to work alongside - everyone is so passionate and warm and open to meeting each other.

Close,Build a house you want to live in,5.0,"Close is an amazing place to work because of a great remote-first culture, a focus on high-quality work, and a high level of trust/autonomy.

The company has a value of ""Build a house you want to live in"" which is reflected in a number of ways: 
1) Employees stick around - not high churn
2) High quality work, product, and codebase
3) People care about the company, their work, and each other
4) A truly remote-only culture with an emphasize on async work

Finally ‚Äì it's very clear the company cares about each individual, new and old. A recent example of this was how thoughtfully the company handled an uncertain situation at the beginning of COVID-19.

Compensation & benefits are very good, especially for remote.",High expectations; you have to be very self-motivated; limited opportunities for growing into people management since the company is relatively small (< 50) - however there are lots of other growth/leadership opportunities for individual contributors.,8 Jun 2021 - Engineering

Close,"A truly inclusive, hard-working, and fun team!",5.0,"Having worked remotely for almost a decade at various companies, I can safely say that Close is better equipped for remote than most other companies. Workaholism is never encouraged or praised. Instead, work-life balance is regularly celebrated (seriously, there's even a Slack channel for it). 

The best part of Close is the people. This is a seriously fun bunch who are all focused on and dedicated to giving the best to our customers. 

As someone with a disability, I sometimes find it hard to find my place in a group. But everyone on my immediate team (and really within the whole company) has been extremely understanding and helpful, even before they knew about my disability.

Leadership at Close is honest and straightforward, they openly recognize their mistakes and are constantly working to improve the work-life of the employees. 

I always recommend Close as a great place to work for my family and friends. I wish all remote companies were like this!",None that I can think of!,8 Jun 2021 - Marketing
Close,Racist Leadership,1.0,"- Some nice coworkers
- Remote work
- The product is pretty good","I cannot hold my tongue any longer. During the yearly team retreats the founders say things about minorities that you wouldn‚Äôt believe if I wrote them out here. One of the founders moved to a remote part of the USA to, in his words, ‚Äúpreserve the racial purity of my family‚Äù. Another company leader talked about how he doesn't mind hiring a ""cheap indian programming slave"", but the leaders of the company must all remain white and of European descent. 

I have seen so many great minority candidates get passed over for someone less great who is white. It‚Äôs driving me crazy and I will quit working here soon.

If you don‚Äôt believe it, take a look at their team photo. These people are white supremacists and you shouldn‚Äôt do business with them.",7 May 2021 - Senior Software Engineer
Close,"Solid Company, No Regrets Joining",5.0,"The company culture is really great. There's a culture around transparency and no BS. No wasting time sitting in pointless meetings. If you think something needs to change, you're encouraged to say so. If you feel you need clarification on something (e.g. during a presentation), you're encouraged to ask. Decisions are data driven. Discussions are productive and focused on outcomes.

The people I work will really are professionals and are fantastic to work with. There's nobody who could leave and I wouldn't care (and this definitely wasn't true in some previous places I've worked).

I feel like I'm trusted and empowered to actually do the work that needs to be done. There's enough difficult problems that there's always something interesting to work on.

I think I've literally used this phase when talking to some former colleagues: ""Turns out sometimes the grass actually is greener.""","None really to speak of. I feel comfortable having frank conversations about anything that comes up, and these usually turn into collaborative discussions about ""how can we solve this problem?"".",30 Sept 2020 - Senior Software Engineer
Close,Legit employee review: It's better than I could have anticipated!,5.0,"Working at Close has been a blast! When I applied to work there, I read all the Glassdoor reviews and to be honest, was kinda like, ""Sure, yeah, whatever - this is probably the typical 'Glassdoor window dressing' stuff."" 

So while I was excited about accepting an offer to work with their team, I was also a bit skeptical that my perception of great people doing great work would be quickly disappointed, so I lowered my expectations preparing to be mildly disappointed. 

Amazingly, I haven't been disappointed at all - actually, surprised by how legitimately kind, humble, and thoughtful the team is to work alongside daily. We joke, we laugh, we work hard - and working with people who care about their customers and the results (and how they achieve those results!) is a total breathe of fresh air. 

After starting here, I was given a copy of the book ""Rework"" written by Jason Friedman and DHH from Basecamp as a, ""Hey, read this - it explains a lot of how we think about what we do."" I was already a huge fan of how Basecamp operates, so I was immediately impressed. As the months continued, I've had more experiences that show the company lives up to the hype. For example, one evening my manager basically (kindly) scolded me for NOT having my ""Do Not Disturb"" enabled on Slack so I can unplug from my work when I'm not at my desk. Who does that stuff these days??? So awesome.  

There's a prevailing sense of confident-humility that's quick to own up to poor decisions, acknowledges real skill and ability, praises good choices, and defaults toward action and getting stuff done. Close has some many people scattered around the world from different cultures, backgrounds, and ethnicities - and I feel like I'm continually learning from their life experiences and perspectives as well.","It's not for everyone. If amid uncertainty, you don't naturally default toward action (e.g., ""I'm not sure, but I can figure it out...""), you likely won't be a fit at Close. In that same vein, you likely won't be a fit if you're intimidated to ask questions - even seemingly silly ones. As a culture, we question ourselves, our peers, our processes, and choices from last week, month, or year. So if you're not comfortable reconsidering what seemed best yesterday - or asking questions about it, you likely won't be a fit. 

The team works hard but has strong expectations that you unplug, step away, and recharge - and if you can't manage yourself (both by showing up and also showing yourself out), you likely won't be a fit here. 

Additionally, a common denominator here is the ability to admit when you're wrong - but also a strength in being able to stand behind your decisions. In other words, owning your work, outcomes, and choices. No one acts defeated or like a whipped puppy. The culture is warm, forgiving, and supportive - but if you're more about defending your actions (defensive) than owning the results (humble strength), you'll likely struggle with the open and honest culture.",26 Mar 2019 - Customer Success Executive
Close,10/10 on all fronts,5.0,"*The company value their employees more than anywhere I have ever worked. We were sent a care package from the CEO during our busy period at the start of the year with vitamins, chocolates and other goodies

Close,Went from contract to full-time (remote) and love it,5.0,"I can't stress enough how much emphasis is placed on deliverables over ""number of hours worked"" in a given week. Managers and the CEO work extremely hard with individual contributors to agree on realistic projects, deadlines, deliverables and to empower employees to go out and do what they're hired to do. There's very little oversight from managers on a daily basis, as they fully trust people to go out and execute on the tasks that are mutually agreed upon. Another major plus has been how few meetings the company has in general.. it varies a bit based on team/role, but there's never a useless meeting to talk just for the sake of ""talking"" about a project, campaign or goal. We have great weekly team meetings over Zoom and then split off into groups of 3 for more personal, fun conversations with each other, and then it's off to the races. The twice yearly, week-long team retreats are also some of the most fun I've ever had with a company work trip.","Right now I'm six months into my role full-time after being a contractor for the previous year, and there have been pretty much zero cons. Everyone (and everything) has been exactly as represented during the interview process and whenever there's a little thing I'm frustrated about or want to change in my workflow, the minute I express that to my manager, we have a very open dialogue about how to solve it and get to a place where everyone's happy and the ship keeps moving in the right direction.",29 May 2018 - Content Marketing Manager

By unique, I mean that it's not everyday that you find a job that you love, with a team that you look forward to spending time with, at a company that prioritizes continuous truth-seeking, trusting your team, and embracing the ridiculous.  By positive, I do not mean that it's not challenging or hard work, but it's the type of hard work that you look forward to waking up in the morning and diving into. The entire team practices what they preach and the culture of the company is very accurately presented during the hiring process.","If you are new to remote work, I would just encourage you to honestly think about what it would take for you to be successful in a 100% remote work environment.

Close,Work with a small team of insanely productive rockstars from all over the world,5.0,"When first joining the Close.io - I was a bit concerned that ""remote"" would really translate into ""out of the loop."" Having worked at companies with an HQ and remote teams, this was the norm. However, once I started, I was blown away at how wrong I was. A lot of that comes from the fact that everyone is remote, not just you, so there's a common understanding of what everyone needs from each other. Also, we hire from all across the globe, so you'll be working with some of the most interesting people you can find. Everyone believes in what we're set out to help people accomplish, and in a customer facing role, you get to see that impact every day.","This is not a con for me, but I wouldn't recommend this job if you're not a self-starter. People will probably say that about any job, but it's especially true when you're working at a small remote company that produces like teams 2-3x it's size. There's little time for oversight and direction, so you're given a high level of autonomy and expected to run with it.

Close,Happiest 5 years of my professional life,5.0,"I've been with the company for over 5 years and I'm still not looking for anything else! The product is very fun to work on and I'm often inspired by the amount of positive feedback we're receiving from our customers. However, the main ""pro"" for me is definitely the team. The leadership is by far the most competent and thoughtful from all the companies I've worked at. You can be sure that the person responsible for you a) knows your job very well, b) has high standards, c) cares about you. You can also be sure you'll be given a lot of trust and responsibility. This might be less apparent in the first month of so of your employment, but then picks up very quickly.

Expect the product, the team, and your responsibilities to grow at a pace that's just at the edge of your comfort zone, which makes for an ever-challenging and very educational environment.

I'm also very grateful for the fact that I can work from anywhere in the world. It takes discipline, but when done well, significantly expands your freedom.

Lastly, team retreats are a blast!","Remote work might be a bit tough in the beginning if you're not used to it. I had to grow a lot of discipline around personal habits and communication in the early years. But, as I said above, once that's done, it's great.",12 Feb 2018 - Software Engineer

Don't expect a rigid set of rules for you to ""win"" the game - you are here to write the rules of the game! You must be confident, while backing up your input with data. Be humble, because teammates *will* question or challenge your viewpoints. Be ready for a startup that recognizes all the areas it needs to work on, but will not work at them all at once because we must ruthlessly prioritize.

Cockroach Labs,An Exceptional Company,5.0,"I've been a software engineer for a decade now, having worked for various companies from tiny pre-seed startups to Big Tech. Cockroach Labs is, hands down, the best company I've ever worked at.

- Work/life balance is superb, not only by startup standards but also compared to the entire industry. When people say you don't have to work too much, they mean it; as an example, one of the co-founders stops working at 5PM promptly every day. Flex Fridays are not a gimmick and are incredibly refreshing to have every week. Some people work more than others out of self-interest, but I have felt zero implication from any leadership that I should ever work myself harder. I burned out pretty severely at my last job and felt a lot of trepidation jumping back into work, but I found the genuinely supportive environment here restorative, and rediscovered that hey, I still love coding after all.

- Remote work is fully supported. I interviewed with many companies this latest round of job searching, and Cockroach Labs was the only company that gave me a straight answer that remote work would be fully supported forever, which I really valued. My own team is spread across multiple states and countries.

- Inclusivity and respect are emphasized, from the leadership all the way down. People listen to each other. A sense of commitment to respect pervades the culture here, and I can jump into any meeting or chat knowing that my voice and opinion will be appreciated.

- As the cherry on top, the company feels like a rocket ship. The company is in a period of rapid growth in all respects; look at our recent fundraising history if you'd like a window into this. The database market is undergoing a massive shift across the tech industry, and Cockroach Labs is extremely well-situated to take huge advantage of it.","On the engineering side, the product has developed extremely rapidly. This means that a fair amount of tech debt has accumulated, and you will more than likely have to spend time helping to pay some of it down in addition to building shiny new features. Additionally, the developer infrastructure in my particular area feels somewhat fragmented; I think more emphasis needs to be placed on streamlining it all around, especially since the engineering team has grown so fast and bits of friction are compounded.

On the process and planning side, there are some natural growing pains as well. The company size has reached the point that distributing and discovering information is becoming more difficult, and while addressing this is top of mind, it is still an ongoing issue to figure out who the right person to talk to is, where the docs are for something, etc. The planning process also has been updated every quarter which makes it a little hard to wrap my head around.

I also think that diversity in the company could be improved. By and large, the demographics are not very different from that of your typical tech company. People care and there are efforts to address this, but the current numbers speak for themselves and I think more effort could be put into materially increasing diversity here.",24 Feb 2022 - Member Of Technical Staff

Cockroach Labs,Best place I've ever worked,5.0,Great culture and interesting work that will help you grow as an engineer,Nothing that isn't true of any other startup,3 Feb 2020 - Member Of Technical Staff
Cockroach Labs,Great job if you fit in,2.0,"The work is challenging and engaging, and it gave me the opportunity to develop some valuable software engineering skills in a relatively short period of time. The engineering standards are high, especially due to the fact that the code base is open source and available for the general public to see.
In addition to the work, there were some common non-work related perks such as free food and snacks in the kitchen, catered lunch, beer, comfy couches and such to entice you to stay at the office longer. They also provide you dedicated funds for learning to attend conferences to develop your skills further. Cockroach Labs develops a database, nothing more. If databases give you a hard on, and you don't have many interests outside of software development, this is an excellent company to work for. Most everyone believes in the company mission, but be sure you do to before deciding to work there.","In my opinion, there is a lot of pretentiousness and arrogance in the engineering department, especially for the senior members and management. As an engineer with only a few years experience, asking questions and trying to seek guidance was a difficult task to achieve. Often times if I were to ask a ""stupid"" question, I received a strong sense of being looked down upon and judged before being given a hesitant answer that only answered my question at the surface level. In other words, they didn't care about me or my growth as a software engineer. The ""flex Fridays"" are heavily advertised, as having your Friday to work on other projects, catch up on work, or take off completely. But it's really a ploy to entice candidates to accept the offer (disclaimer, I am strictly speaking as a software engineer).
Being a startup, a lot is expected of you. Long hours, being logged on well into the evening hours, and working weekends. This would all be fine if you knew what you were getting into, but it's never said, only expected. Honestly, they preach a work life balance, which is even more frustrating since the reality is nothing of the sort.
Like I said in the pros, if software engineering is your only interest, you're a software development wiz, or you just absolutely love designing and thinking about databases, by all means, this is for you. But if you're someone who is looking for a job that will give you back what you put in, be cautious. I advise you to ask skeptical and challenging questions in your interview process. And ask what team you will be joining and make sure you speak with your manager before accepting the position to ensure you will have a healthy working relationship.",14 Dec 2019 - Member Of Technical Staff

I love the abundance of female coworkers and leaders. Having Katherine as our CEO really seems to have influenced our culture, making Coconut a comfortable place to work as a woman (which isn't always the case in tech).

I would recommend working at Coconut to anyone and everyone.","We're still going through growing pains - but I'm pretty sure that they're common in startups and tech. 

The pandemic got us to start hiring staff that are fully remote, and our offices are hybrid (you can come in if you want to, but you don't have to). The flexibility is great, but expectations and visibility across projects can be difficult to navigate.

Leadership is learning. During my time at Coconut I've seen a fair bit of turn over in our mid-management. I think it would be really valuable to give them more training, support, and close mentorship as their management has been quite inconsistent.

Coconut Software,"Work Smart, Go Home",5.0,"Pros
- Truly People-First Culture
- Inspirational Founders
- Focussed on Real Problems

Coconut collaborates closely with local businesses to solve problems real humans have. The credit union I personally use is a customer of Coconut, and it always brings me immense joy to use the software I helped write in order to easily book an appointment with my advisor, rather than relying on the arduous process of telephone/email tag you have to go through with other businesses.

Regarding company culture, it's one thing to talk the talk and say you're 'People-First' and another to walk the walk, especially as a company scales beyond a small startup. That being said, I am continually amazed at how Coconut commits itself to improving the lives of its employees. Coconut takes direct steps towards tackling complex matters such as: mental health, diversity, equality and maintaining a healthy work/life balance (especially throughout COVID). I imagine this is largely due to Coconut's inspiring CEO Katherine and the core values she has instilled throughout the company. Katherine is just as (probably more) ambitious and driven to succeed than her male CEO counterparts I've worked for, while also caring deeply about how that success comes to be. There is no 'winning at all costs' mentality that I've seen a lot of other companies fall into, and I just generally feel like a better person having worked here for the past couple years.","Cons
- Some Anti-Agile Customers
- Complex Competitive Market
- ???

I'm genuinely struggling to think of cons or negative experiences I had at Coconut, so I'll nit pick a few things. In short, some of Coconut's customers are slow moving dinosaurs (from a technology perspective). That isn't meant to be a criticism necessarily, I understand financial institutions operate in an extremely risk-averse business domain, leading them to be more cautious around new technologies in general. But it can be frustrating to require a 3rd technical onboarding call with the same customer because some 'Associate Vice President of Cybersecurity' wasn't on the previous calls and has a question about Kubernetes that could've easily been an email. These large enterprises also typically use older or custom technologies which comes with its own integration challenges (some good, like containerizing your applications to run in someone else's cluster securely, some bad, like integrating with their own in-house legacy email client). The business domain Coconut operates in is growing increasingly more competitive (FinTech), resulting in rapidly changing product strategies. This can lead to a feeling of disconnect between the engineering work being done and any metrics or results the company cares about.

Neither of these are really criticisms of Coconut, more so of the businesses they've chosen to work with, but I honestly can't think of anything else to complain about. The only reason I left Coconut was to pursue a startup opportunity, and if it fails Coconut will be the first place I apply to.",8 Jun 2021 - Senior Developer

What's really interesting is that all the different business units are not competing internally, so there is no political agenda holding back the organization. Katherine (CEO) has done a great job ensuring that the business runs at full steam without any of the red tape. The structure of executives and responsibilities ensures that Marketing is not fighting with Sales, and Sales isn't chasing Development.","The organization is still small and there is a long way to go before thinking about where the organization going to be in the future. This is quite normal for an organization of this size, but you have to be prepared to understand that before you join.

I work in the Toronto office so I don‚Äôt get to see our lovely CEO as much as I‚Äôd like to.

The Toronto office is an open space where sales, marketing, customer experience, and our project management team resides, along with our CRO. Our CRO is full of insight and even though he‚Äôs extremely busy, he makes time and has an open door policy for anyone to approach him with anything, and that‚Äôs something I value highly.

Pay is just okay but the benefits package is very strong.","D‚ÄôYouville used to be a place of caring and one big family for over a decade I loved working for this company. 

Unfortunately within the last two years or so the culture has been totally destroyed by incoming upper management. Numerous longtime employees forced out or fired often without just cause as noted by multiple lawsuits some of which are still pending. 

Mass firing with included the entire Education Department and Institutional advancement (fundraising department) the latter had no real explanation given.

Numerous positions were filled by friends of the new upper management without proper searches. A front page article in the Buffalo News article on 8/3/20 was accurate in terms of the culture and how it is turning very toxic and there has been internal blowback to a few of those who are still employees but spoke out publicly including the president calling a couple them bullies by name at an all hands meeting before the start of Fall 2020 semester. 

The administration has tried to blame covid after furloughing then firing about 60 people with a couple from almost every department but many of these issues have been building long before. The employees were fired on Columbus Day/Canadian thanksgiving a day the college is officially closed and Channel 2 news knew over 2 hours before the employees themselves were notified. Can't even get that correct. While Covid has caused a decrease in upcoming enrollment the issues with spending were believed by many employees to have started long before.

Physical renovations which were much needed but have been taken to the extreme have risked the financial stability of the college and the Board of Trustees seems to have no interest in reigning in the excess this includes a recent purchase of the neighboring church and rectory for 1.2 million during Covid while also building a brand new building. Academic Department budgets are being slashed for the upcoming spring 2021 semester but the renovations have not been scaled back to try to compensate the budget to this point. 

The dismantling of the Campus Ministry and Mission Integration departments have ensured that the faith based part of the colleges mission no longer has a proverbial seat at the table of presidents council. Mission Integration was created in the name of Sr. Denise the outgoing president with a donation from the order of nuns who founded the college the department no longer exists as its second director left in less than 2 years.

Previously from PANW and RedLock, we have built tools and products in the cloud cybersecurity space to undeniable success. This is our next venture and journey in making another mark in the space.
3. Culture is chill
We just want to build cool things with good coworkers without the politics. Sandals and hoodies in the office type of environment -- we love to work with people who don't treat themselves too seriously.","1. Not fully remote-ish
Due to the pandemic, many professionals have switched to being fully remote. Although our preference is 4 days of the week in the office (4 day work week currently), we are flexible with WFH.
2. Fast paced and plans can always be changing
Early stage startup problems: we're building things while still trying to figure out. Sprints with new discoveries and spiked Sprint throughput means that work can be hectic. Because of the 4 day work week, staying and/or doing work late hours may be required. Leadership / management is open to dialogue if things get too hectic. Taking ownership and putting in the extra mile is rewarding because the leadership / management is empathetic to the startup struggles.",24 Aug 2021 - Software Engineer
Dassana,The Dream Team!,5.0,"I've worked with the leadership team in the past at a previous startup so when they started this venture and asked me to come back it was a no brainer for me to work with them again. This is my third startup and although I haven't been here for more than a year (yet) - I couldn't imagine seeing myself anywhere else. 
 
-Leadership team is awesome + brings deep domain experience - shares strategic direction throughout the organization. 
- Feedback rich culture that is inclusive and encouraging. 
-Amazing product vision and execution.
-Life and work harmony is consistently promoted/embodied.

Oh! Almost forgot to mention - Dassana recently implemented a four day work week! When I mentioned life and work harmony is embodied, it truly is and it's on another level.","Dassana is at its seed stage which is fairly early. As with any startup, there are growing pains. Personally, early stage startups are my cup of tea and some...but it's not for everyone. There's a huge opportunity to shape the company and have major impacts - personal and professional growth. With that said, having a ""startup mentality"" is a necessity as there are a lot of moving parts and you will most likely be wearing multiple hats.

I don't really see this as a con - it's a matter of your perception of startups. If you enjoy small teams and growing + learning alongside some pretty rad folks, then this potentially may be the place for you.",4 Aug 2021 - Business Operations

Outright bullying from the founder is tolerated under the guise of ‚Äústart-up culture,‚Äù and there is no HR department to hold anyone accountable. The favouritism at this company is blinding and founded in nothing but personal preference.

Such low turnover is unheard of in agency work. But not at Digible, and it is no wonder that no one wants to leave - the agency is amazing.

You hear many companies tout ""amazing culture"" and ""work-life balance"" only to reward their employees with a handful of summer Fridays or pizza parties. Not Digible. They are walking the walk and rolling out 4 day work weeks (yes, you read that right). 

It is initiatives like that that really highlight Digible's values and culture. It is a place that recognizes that at the end of the day, we are all people, we all have lives outside of work, and leadership genuinely cares about people getting the time to enjoy those lives.

DNSFilter,An awesome tech company with a lot of momentum,5.0,"So I actually joined DNSFilter close to a year ago as an Account Executive.

I was so burnt out on sales that I took some time off before giving DNSFilter a shot.  I was used to calling 100-150 real estate agents every day and selling them a product that wouldn‚Äôt work 90% of the time.  

Right away when I joined DNSFilter I noticed a few things that were very different.

When I would talk to customers they were excited to talk about DNSFilter and love the product.  We have way more flexibility on things like pricing and can actually negotiate deals.  The vast majority of customers inbounded to us and were just really cool people and easy to work with.  It‚Äôs mainly selling to sysadmins/MSPs so they are normally happy to chat and after a year I‚Äôve only had 1 or 2 conversations that weren‚Äôt positive. 

I was able to come in right away and learn a technical product and start closing deals without a long ramp time.  I will say it takes the right type of person to sell DNSFilter - it‚Äôs not something you can just brainlessly dial and sell like lead gen.  You have to be a little bit on the techy side and willing to do a deep dive into the network security world and level up quickly if you want to be effective. 

By far my favorite thing about DNSFilter is that they really want to improve and will reward you if you work hard.  In past jobs I was the type of person that would constantly be brainstorming ways to improve the data in our CRM, prospecting tools, sales method, etc. and almost always get shut down by upper management.

DNSFilter is the exact opposite -  if you are smart, hard working and want to see your ideas get implemented you don‚Äôt find a more exciting company than DNSFilter.  In the time I‚Äôve been here I‚Äôve seen multiple employees able to rise up into leadership positions and the founders believe strongly in promoting from within. 

Outside of that - we were working remotely before it was cool and even positions like the sales team which might be based in Denver have the ability to work remotely.   We have a great culture with founders that are active in things like slack, online happy hours, etc. so you‚Äôll get face time with every department.","As you can probably tell from the rest of my review I don‚Äôt have many cons but I will give a little bit of a warning.  This is not a job where you can coast and do the bare minimum.

We are at a stage as a company where every single employee is expected to pitch in and do things outside of their job description if needed.  Even though I‚Äôve been an account executive/sales manager during my time here I‚Äôve helped with issues regarding billing, support, product management, etc. 

It‚Äôs also not a simple product and the employees that have had the most success are the ones that aren‚Äôt scared to ask questions and take on responsibilities/projects without being asked.  Most departments have training programs set up but it‚Äôs not going to be like working for a massive tech company where they have dedicated trainers/teachers.  You‚Äôll need to be self-motivated and hit the ground running to maximize your time here.",18 Aug 2020 - Sales Manager

Eidos-Montr√©al,Happy I made the switch - No kool-aid needed,5.0,"I came to Eidos from another studio because I was tired of the ridiculous politics and having to get 10 levels of approval for any change.  I was hesitant at first, but the people I met in my interview had gone through the same experience in the past, and they were upfront and transparent with me - not to mention that many of my former colleagues had already made the switch - and once I started, things were pretty much the same as they described. After over a year here, I have no regrets at all. 
No studio is perfect, but I see the difference in that people support each other and you get the feeling that everyone around you is pushing toward the same goal. The projects are awesome and definitely challenging, but I would rather be in an environment where I can grow and be proud of my work, than be put in a corner and told what to do like a machine.  
I can't speak for everyone, but I am having more fun here than I've had in my 8 year career, and it seems like everyone around me shares the same sentiment. It's not about drinking the kool-aid, because I genuinely think that management is doing their best to listen to us and make necessary changes. 

For the rest of the perks, one huge difference I noticed is the level of flexibility and understanding for overtime and having work-life balance. Beer Fridays and parties are great, but I think the best part is that I can bank my overtime as vacation. Kids get sick and emergencies happen, and they definitely show a human side when it comes to these situations.","It would be great to have more insight into what's happening on other projects.

Eidos-Montr√©al,Many fundamental issues,2.0,"The studio has some of the greatest AAA IPs when it comes to creativity and innovation potential (Thief, Deus Ex)
Very friendly atmosphere in the teams with incredibly talented artists and devs.
Experts who stay long enough will see their experience rewarded with more responsibilities and trust.
Numerous social advantages, including:
Transport card covered, depending on your seniority
Unlimited sick days
Tax saving retirement account
but the most outstanding is the ability to bank your overtime hours, which is a unique case in the industry.","Strategy
The studio is a middle sized one (the likes of Naughty Dogs or Crystal Dynamics) but suffers from a lack of vision and focus that are overshadowed by excessive ambitions, and ideas not fully thought through.
It is developing multi-platform games but relies on proprietary engines, mostly different for each project, preventing any form of knowledge building.
This also leads to massive technical hurdles and production constraints that not only impact productivity but also causes significant frustration to the teams.
The studio doesn‚Äôt have the critical size to handle multiple AAA development and scatters its resources instead of building its strength on a single franchise before looking for growth.
It is trying to maintain multiple initiatives, without the required resources, and sometimes against the global strategy dictated by its holding, the Square Enix group.
Whether it is by ambition, or to eventually break free from Square Enix, it is in both cases poorly executed and has already caused damages to the studio.
Each project ends up being the next adrenaline shot that keeps the studio alive, where it could be building an expertise to help the studio differentiate from the competition.
 
Projects
Two of their IPs (Thief, Deus Ex) are now without any publicly known plan for further iterations. This is partly due to the fact that those games are directed to a limited market and can only make so much profit, but also that the potential of the latest entries hasn‚Äôt been fully realized.
The lack of creative vision and the director‚Äôs tendency to always refer to their past experiences prevent the teams from moving forward, take risks and seek excellence in innovation.
Similarly to their engines, projects use different production methods, which is fine when making different types of games, but it is done without trying to establish best practices. Each project ends up trying to reinvent the wheel, with all the problems that come with it.
Plannings are made up by producers, who barely consult leads, principals or experts, only to redo them completely every 6 month, when they get a reality check.
Raising any kind of flags is seen as having a negative attitude and not being solution oriented.
As long as you always say yes and are doing overtime to compensate for the made up estimate, you‚Äôll be seen as a true committed resource, and will be granted the right to not challenge the way things are done.
 
 
Management
On a studio level, it is highly politicized. Producers and Directors get hired based on their affinity with the higher management, sometimes even without any proven or relevant background.
If you‚Äôre a dev or artist, then, like in any other company in any industry, it will depends on the position you have, and the manager you get.
You will find the best and the worst.
Ultimately, your fate lies in the ends of the studio producers, who manage the resources assignments on the different projects, so‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ make sure to have a strong ‚Äúinfluence leadership‚Äù if you want to be in a good position.
If you‚Äôre doing a good job, chances are they will make you chase the carrot and work even more, and tell everyone how committed you are for doing so much overtime.
If you‚Äôre underperforming, nothing will be said to you before you reach the (arbitrary) critical point where you will either, be given a remedial plan, be ramped down on another project, or simply get fired. And sadly, if they don‚Äôt have a file to justify the move, they‚Äôll simply abrogate the position.
 
 
HR
This is where things get complicated.
From a studio perspective, the HR department mission is simple: to protect the legal integrity of the studio, at all cost, and to cover the higher management.
Career management is nowhere to be found and the evaluation process won‚Äôt change anything, as scores and their criteria are arbitrarily change to accomodate the project or studio‚Äôs current situation.
The main issue lies in the environment in which Eidos Montreal operates.
Montreal is a highly competitive place when it comes to AAA development. This make for extreme difficulties when it comes to attract talents and build employees loyalty.
The studio has such a hard time hiring, that more often than not, it ends up settling for any resource available.
This is already a problem on its own, but instead of trying to be part of a solution, Eidos Montreal enforces the issue.
Instead of encouraging the most committed and deserving employees, the studio will promote the ones who threat to leave, granting them custom titles to try to make them fit in the hierarchy, messing it up and diluting ownership of the projects in the process.
Projects end up having an unbalanced ratio of directors and leads compared to devs and artists.
All this entitlement brings so many cooks in the kitchen that making a decision becomes an excruciating process.
Also, promotions, even when deserved, are never followed by any real training, except for generic seminars that only scratch the surface.
Experts become leads but then have no idea how to manage people, and get blamed for not knowing about it instinctively.
In some cases, this can go as far as to have extremely talented resources who end up, after being promoted, be the main reason for which artists and devs would leave the company.
The turn over has been high the past few years, despite the relatively good work conditions and numerous advantages. The frustration of being the ones paying for the higher ups mistakes is the number one reason. 
 
Finally, be careful, direct criticism of the management and/or direction, even constructive, can result at best in you being put in a corner until you leave, or in the studio thanking you for your services.",29 Aug 2018 - Anonymous Employee

Performance reviews are non existent unless they need to cut heads, then you‚Äôll mysteriously be informed you failed it (you will not ever see this review.). Watch yourself when you get close to your two years there, they know they can fire you without triggering legal repercussions because dismissal laws don‚Äôt kick in for Quebec until 2 years.  If even one producer doesn‚Äôt like you, they will drum up some reason to fire you without any input from your managers.

And they‚Äôre not even pulling out any kind of successes to justify this.  This is a company where franchises go to die.  They‚Äôve killed Thief, they‚Äôve killed Deus Ex, they‚Äôre about to kill Tomb Raider.  Sooner or later Japan is going to get tired of having their obey wasted and that is not going to be pretty.

1. The worst thing of all in that company is the management. Doesn't matters the department you are working on. They are here since the beginning of the studio and agree with their plan or not, they are going to stay. No sense of priority, organization, structure and no people skill at all. You are going to submit ideas, they are going to reject it and 6 month later they will propose the same idea but in their name. 

2. If you want a promotion, you better start kissing them, or you need to have good connection with higher people. Because it's not based on how well your do the job, but more about. Who you know and who back you can scratch.

3. They give no feedback at all. So you cannot know if you did a good job. The only time you know its at the annual evaluation and even there prepare yourself.
The evaluation is on 4. Below 2 well you are out. 4, you need to be a pillar of.tje company to have it. Generally their are just going to give you 2.5 or 3 for doing your job. (Also this affected your base salary each year)

4.No formation. They not want to invest on an employee. For them it's cheap labor. You better talk with your co-worker to have access to that knowledge because the other way is to try to do something by yourself. And hey if you don't succeed they are going to blame it on you.

5. No tools. You need to do your job with what you have. Sometimes you will works with something that even Frankenstein's Monster will say: nope, don't use that, it will collapse!

6.HR are at the company's service, not yours. If you have an issue they will probably side with the management. Making it really hard to fight for your right (see what I did there!!)

7. The  mentality. It's negative reinforcement they call it. Basically, they will treat you like human garbage, but with a smile and while laughing, so it's.not try right guys?

Supportive of personal situations and take care of employees mental health. 4 day week,No current cons to name,25 Apr 2022 - Digital PR Lead
Evolved Search,No other workplace like it,5.0,"If you told me an agency like this (particularly in the digital marketing industry) existed I'd have laughed in your face and called you a liar. Evolved is an amazing place to work and cannot be compared to other agencies.

You feel cared for by senior management. This is put into practice by having approachable, friendly, and empathetic managers who care for your wellbeing inside and outside of work. I have experienced personal troubles outside of work which I brought to my line manager's attention, I was treated with respect and given support to deal with it.

We have a four-day workweek which helps with productivity and enforces a great work-life balance. We can also balance our hours over the month so we can work flexibly and to our own schedules.

Monthly 121s that aren't delayed or pushed back incessantly.

Private health insurance.

A fantastic company culture where everyone fits in and is free to be themselves. Everyone is friendly and welcoming, there is no cliquey atmosphere!

The first place I've worked where I don't get Sunday scaries. I am well rested from a 3 day weekend to come back to work motivated and happy.

You're asked for regular feedback. Senior management are always prepared to listen to staff's opinions to improve anything they can.

Staff members are recognised for their work and achievements regularly.

High quality work and colleagues who are extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Everyone helps each other out. The definition of teamwork exists at Evolved as nobody is throwing each other under the bus or making negative comments/putting others down.

Keen for personal development which is completed in work time.

Transparent culture where everyone is well informed about the business.

Dogs are allowed in the office.

A company that takes its culture seriously with dedicated values sessions to make sure everyone is on board with what is expected from you.

Well paid salary (well above a lot of other agencies) with a clear structure for promotions and progression.",Can't think of one thing,7 Mar 2022 - Content Marketing Executive
Evolved Search,"Progression, work culture & benefits - all 10/10",5.0,"I can never see me leaving this company if it stays as it is ""culture"" wise. They put you first always! 

The BUPA private healthcare is by far the best benefit they offer and I pray is something they keep forever. This includes mental health cover and I know this is something many people have taken advantage of and are so so grateful for. The 4 day work week is a new benefit that is proving highly beneficial - I now feel ready to come to work after a long weekend rather than dreading it and wishing the weekend had slowed down. 

They listen to you no matter how small or big the topic is and no matter what level you are at. You are always a priority to them! You received monthly 1 to 1s with your manager to review anything (at all) you have to say and where they can give feedback. They have quarterly appraisals to discuss your performance (your chance to push progression). And annual pay reviews. 

You are given both charity hours and personal development hours. This is your chance to work on you and your career. They will give you a budget to find a course (or they have a few suggestions based on a skills test they pay for you to take to see your gaps of knowledge in digital marketing) for you and your progression in whatever role you take. Charity hours are fantastic. You can take part in the whole team charity events like marathon walks or all nighter  stay awake events for homelessness, or use your hours to do personal charity work.

There is a great atmosphere here - we all get along and make an effort to do things out of work. Everyone fits in so well and has a similar attitude. Work hard, play hard. No working over your 32 hours and no working late.","The only thing that other agencies have to offer us on the likes of LinkedIn that overtakes anything that Evolved has to offer is wage. Wages have been benchmarked from averages across the UK. However, i feel these are still (only slightly) lower than what we should be getting for the work we are producing. I would like to see these reviewed annually. 

It's sometimes a bit too fast paced that you feel overwhelmed. I think they need to start realising how fast the agency is moving and hiring with anticipation for new work because sometimes the hiring is slower than the work coming in. As work speeds up quality goes down so it would benefit everyone.",21 Nov 2021 - Anonymous Employee
Evolved Search,Actually lives up to expectations,5.0,"Nothing makes me happier than having my expectations set, met and even exceeded by my employer - and that's what I get at Evolved.

Naturally during COVID and ""post-COVID"" (if we can even call it that), there were concerns about safety and office working. Evolved ensured that each and every staff member had their say about whether they wanted an office return and what it would look like, and no one forced us - or is even forcing us still - to return to the office if we don't want to. Something that unfortunately can't be said for other agencies as I've heard many complaints from friends and ex-colleagues of their experiences at other places.

Working during 2020 was extremely difficult - the company recognised how much stress we were under (a lot of clients saw a drop in demand, some lowered retainer until times were a bit more certain, furlough etc.) and how we all switched on to ensure that clients' needs were seen to first. The company first and foremost made sure we were okay, providing us with mental health resources, including information on how we can utilise the BUPA healthcare we all have, as well as other things. But we were also rewarded with a cash bonus towards the end of the financial year, which was unexpected but very much appreciated.

At my previous agencies, things like conferences and award ceremonies were only attended by senior members of staff or management - sort of like some 'eliteist' club. But if they want, everyone at Evolved is offered the chance to attend an award's ceremony or attend a conference or external training session, and in fact we all get a healthy annual training budget and personal development time in work to go towards andragogy - the company really invests in us and our career. A lot of support and training has been given to those interested in speaking too.

In August the company introduced a 4-day work week, which has been life-changing for me and the rest of my team. We now have 3 days a week we can totally switch off from work, and we're actively encouraged to not check emails or Slacks on these days. The company have introduced things to ensure that clients are still dealt with even if the assigned person to the account is not available, and while it is still a trial, it's being changed and updated based on OUR feedback - the people it actually impacts the most! Evolved know that people are what makes Evolved and we are so cared for and considered throughout every single stage of development.

Any decision that will impact culture or general happiness isn't considered lightly - like hiring or process changes. Great care is taken by HR, the SMT and directors to make sure that anyone hired is a good fit for the team, or that no one will be upset with something new that's implemented. One thing I love about Evolved is that while we all have our individual teams and departments, everyone gets involved and is up for a laugh - whether this is at company-wide socials or even just giving each other a good light-hearted/sarcastic roast in Slack, there are no catty cliques or rude/toxic people.

The company has grown over the time I've been here, but it's been scalable and controlled in a way to not impact happiness or health (both mental and physical) and I can honestly say the board of directors are some of the most down to earth people that you can meet. At my previous agencies, some of them have never even known my name or cared to even smile at me in the corridor. I was simply just another number to them.

Evolved directors are transparent, approachable and really take great effort to make everyone feel included and human. We have monthly company updates to tell us about new business, sales, finances, promotions and things so everyone is kept in the loop, and every 6 months we have a large presentation often at an external room with drinks to give us a view of where we are now and where we want to head, and questions and feedback are encouraged and open.

The new office is in a great city centre location and every member of staff is considered for the allocated parking spots, we finally have a building that allows dogs so the place is stuffed full of them, a lovely little treat to give strokes after a long days' work. The cupboard is always full of wonderful snacks, free of charge, and we have tea and coffee (not really a perk but a fancy bean-to-cup and milk frother is definitely better than standard kettle and Costco whatever-instant-coffee-is-the-best-value that I've had in the past).

We don't quite get London salaries (I personally think some of those are - while tempting - ridiculously high, but I am Northern...), but we get miles ahead of any other place in Newcastle and it's regularly reviewed to make sure it's actually competitive - at other agencies, gimmicks like 'unlimited holidays', 'free breakfast' etc. was used to subsidise a piddling salary. Not with Evolved - you get a reasonable salary AND a benefits package that is MILES above the others. I've job-hopped in the past to get a wage I can actually live and breathe on, but with Evolved I don't have to. 

I could keep going on and on about the pros of working at Evolved, but I would urge anyone considering a position at Evolved to please go for it and see if it is the right fit for you. It is genuinely a great place to work and I plan on being here for many more years.","The area where I've scored Evolved the lowest in the ratings section is on Diversity & Inclusion. It's not that anyone is made to feel unwelcome at ALL - that's far from the truth as everyone's encouraged to be themselves - but there's definitely steps we can take, like partnering with a specialist organisation or even just adding an equal opportunities disclaimer to job advertisements, to attract a wider pool of talent and make them feel comfortable. I wouldn't say it is a con so to speak, but the company definitely needs to be more proactive in this area.

It can also be relatively fast-paced at times, but any concerns with resource or time are often resolved by hiring or moving around work/setting client expectations. I suppose it is just a part of working at an agency is that there will be busier and quieter times, but Evolved do take the correct action to ensure that we keep stress levels as low as possible and avoid burnout.

- Regular surveys to give employees the chance to express any grievances 
- Regular socials 
- Annual pay reviews
- Monthly agency updates
- Monthly 121s and quarterly appraisals to discuss performance
- Private health insurance 

Besides perks, the senior management team are a great bunch of people. They're approachable and just genuinely care about it being a good place to work. 

It's encouraged by seniors to take regular time off, especially throughout the pandemic. There was a lot of discussion about taking care of our mental health throughout lockdowns and to take breaks if we need it.

Their strong belief in flexible working means that should one day you're feeling less productive or feeling the need for a break, you can work the minimum core hours and make them up the next day.

Evolved also understand that people are keen to excel in their careers and provide so much for personal development. Everyone is allocated monthly personal development time and you work with your manager to design your own plan to suit your career goals. 

Overall, it's a really decent place to work because the management team care and it really shows in everything they introduce for employees.","The only negative is that with great perks and values, comes a heavy workload. I wouldn't advise anyone work for Evolved if they're not keen on working hard to juggle high-budget clients and do a lot of graft. 

 Due to Evolved's rapid growth, it occasionally feels that there's more work than hours in the week and because of heavy workload, personal development is often the thing that has to give in order to accommodate the rest of your work. However, it's usually only until another team member is hired.

Due to a heavy workload, it also means there's not a lot of freedom to be 100% creative and try loads of new ideas for clients. As a creative, my best ideas come from having time and freedom to explore and due to the workload the time to think of those ideas isn't always available.",2 Sept 2021 - Anonymous Employee

Evolved Search is a very rewarding place. The list of benefits on offer is forever growing and seriously impressive. They have recently introduced a 6-month trial of a 4-day working week with no impact on our salary, just less working hours and longer weekends! The holiday package is enhanced too with 28 days holiday per year plus bank holidays.

They have continued to be brilliant throughout the pandemic, regularly keeping the team in touch via online socials such as quizzes, games, and award ceremonies. They have also sent out care packages to enhance the concerning days of the pandemic and boost the spirit of the team during the festive period. Since working from home, they have boosted our salaries with a monthly payment to cover the additional cost of increased gas and electric usage.

Personal development is big at Evolved Search. Monthly 121 meetings take place as well as tri-annual appraisals and bi-annual pay reviews. The twice yearly pay reviews allow team members to discuss salary without it being an awkward issue to raise.

For example, extending 4 day workweeks in response to covid, positioning DEI as a priority, leaning into remote and flexible work, and just being generally empathetic towards flock members.

With all those perks in mind, what really keeps me at Feathr is the informal culture. I'm not worried about being perceived as ""professional"" because of how I dress, how I look, or how I talk. I'm trusted as a professional based on my skills and performance, so I feel like I can be my genuine self at work without judgement.","Feathr is a growing company, and I mean GROWING.

It's as simple as that.","22 Sept 2021 - Director, AMC and Agency Partnerships"
Feathr,Exhilarating Workplace,5.0,"Feathr is a unique and exciting place to work. Despite being over 100 employees, it still feel very much like a startup, given the aggressive growth targets and rate of change. There are certainly pros and cons to this and it may not be everyone's cup of tea. Personally, I love the creativity, innovation, autonomy, and ability to make impact that this type of environment provides. There is never a boring day and you are able to change the organization in meaningful ways and chart your own path if you take initiative. 

The 4-day work week is fantastic. I can't always fit everything in the 4 days, but I like having an extra flexible bonus day for thinking time or overflow tasks.

Despite the chaos in change-heavy seasons, Feathr always has its employees' backs and seems to make a good faith effort to correct missteps. Given that the staff in 2020 was expected to support doubling revenue, I was surprised when we didn't do a layoff in the pandemic. We definitely didn't hit anything close to our goals, so that must have been a difficult (& admirable!) business decision to retain the full team.

Feathr is now hitting its goals and I'm eager to see what that means over the next year.","Roles & responsibilities are not always predictable. Company-wide and cross-dept communication is not always clear. Constantly learning and embracing new skills/processes/industry knowledge/intense growth targets based on recent signals or learnings is expected for most roles. For some personality types, that may sound exhausting and it certainly can be. 

Practicality > Perfection is a core company value which sometimes bleeds into rushing or compromising quality of work. Feathr emphasizes getting a first draft out and then iterating based on real feedback. This can be a difficult adjustment for folks who tend towards more patient working styles and prefer to take more time polishing a first draft to get an initial version ""right."" 

I think most of the cons are inextricably linked with the pros and my acceptance of that has improved my experience at Feathr.",6 Aug 2021 - Anonymous Employee

I feel that the bar has been set so high that it will be hard to match this workplace experience with future employers. There is an incredible amount of trust, respect, and care that Feathr gives to its employees. Feathr works incredibly hard to ensure that its staff is happy - whether that means being a dog-friendly office, giving employees paid Fridays off, providing employees with all supplies and food they need to be comfortable while at the office, or making growth trajectories accessible for any given employee looking to grow. I have had the opportunity to try out a variety of different role types - between leadership and being an individual contributor - to help me understand how and why I work best, and to build my resume. Feathr has been a foundational place in allowing me to grow professionally and personally in a safe space, where I am encouraged to be my best self through actions of kindness, respect, and care from the fellow team and management.

While Feathr is perpetually preoccupied with software updates, unending efficiency hacks, and appearing culturally stable and cool, they seem to forget basic workplace concepts like personal boundaries and proper accountability at the top.

My experience at Feathr was rocky at best. My team was overworked and underdeveloped, and in the end I was ""accidentally"" fired for under-performing with no official warnings or communication from management that it was happening. I was open and transparent about my displeasure it in the work (some they encourage), and was told for months they would find other opportunities in the company for me, as long as I was loyal to them... so I stayed. Only to receive a message at 5PM in Teams from HR out of blue, telling me when my last day would be and severance details.

There was quick backtracking and apologizing - citing that there was miscommunication between management and HR. I was told that this experience was a ""good lesson"" for them. And that they couldn't follow-through with offering me a different position because they were on a ""hiring freeze"" - which was interesting as the team I was on had hired 3 new people during that time. I was upset and angry, and felt totally lied to. They quickly swept the entire situation under the rug, and I heard things like I ""wasn't a good fit.""

When you are given permission to move forward, everything is second-guessed and further micro-managed.

Deals and activities were Micro-managed by CEO, who would constantly claim to have extensive Enterprise Sales experience and knowledge, despite not having any experience closing large Enterprise deals (Companies >1000 employees).

Never gave me a comp plan, despite asking for one at every meeting. Eventually, he verbally gave me my quota, but when I did the math on my commissions noticed that he obviously changed my quota to something at least $100k higher. I trusted that I would be promoted very rapidly since that was always the discussion and understanding, so I did not get anything in writing.

When promotion time came around, CEO himself let me know that unless I got something in writing from him, I do not have anything to stand on (despite that being the understanding during my hiring, and the fact that the internal org chart showed I was managing 7 people, I was listed as their manager, etc.), so I suggest you never trust the CEO at his word, and demand he put everything in writing before you agree to move forward.

I was let go after 364 days (1 day before my year) because I had negotiated manager level equity when I started, and they obviously didn't want me to receive that, so they hired a director to fire me in his first month, and then the director was let go/left shortly after that (Director of Sales lasted less than 5 months).",10 Sept 2021 - Enterprise Account Executive

Headspace,B2B leadership is disconnected from what's really going on :(,1.0,"Headspace's product is simply amazing and is truly accomplishing the company's mission of improving the health and happiness of its' members. Everyone should be thanking the D2C marketing, creative, and product teams for making it what is today as it has opened up many doors for other sectors of the business like Headspace for Work and a lot of sensational brand partnerships like Waze and Star Wars. Additionally, the benefits and compensation package is incredible and highly competitive in the wellness tech/SaaS market. 

While leadership could use some work, I have made lifelong connections with my co-workers and for that, I'm grateful to Headspace.","While Headspace's product is fabulous, simply put the B2B sectors of the organization could use some TLC (even with the Ginger merger). As shown in the previous reviews, quality employees are truly suffering the coincidences of less than ideal senior, executive, and c-suite leadership. I sincerely believe that leadership means well, but truly doesn't realize that a 'pass the buck' / 'not my problem' mentality doesn't reach goals and is aloof to the struggles that the team truly faces. People join Headspace expecting empathetic leadership and psychological safety, given the mission, but as time elapses it all seems like a business tactic. I've seen some quality and experienced individuals leave recently because of burnout, their decline in mental/physical wellbeing, and lack of support/morale from B2B senior managers and directors. Oftentimes, it feels like B2B leaders are great at interpersonal communications and positioning a supportive environment with no real accountability or ownership on their part. Customers are interested in integrating Headspace into their benefits landscape because of the brand recognition of Headspace, a quality mental wellbeing solution, and organic adoption and engagement from their members, but sooner or later unhappy and overworked/under-resourced PSMs/AEs will lead to a substantial amount of turnover, which will lead to dissatisfied customers, which will lead to low retention. It is already happening. Not only that, and as previously stated, quality people are struggling with their mental health because of the above, which is messed up given the nature of the business..",8 Jun 2022 - Anonymous Employee

- No interest or effort to retain diversity
 When I joined, there were 5 female engineers (I'm included in that), at least 3 female managers of engineering teams, a female CEO and CTO. However, in the merger (more on that below), the board of directors chose to keep the white, male CEO and CTO from the other company instead of keeping either of the female CEO or CTO from Headspace. In my year there, 2 of the female engineers left (+ me), as well as a female engineering manager. There was no effort made to keep any of us. Not long before I left, my team did hire another female, who I lobbied heavily for. If women keep leaving Headspace at this rate, there will be no women to lobby for hiring more. 

- Poor pay, by industry standards
 As a L3 (Senior engineer), I made 160k per year. After a year, when I pointed out that I made 10k+ less than my male counterparts in the same role, I was told there wasn't anything to really be done.

- Unclear path for promotions and pay raises
 In the past year, Headspace has been trying to set up a Total Rewards package, which was supposed to address pay, bonuses, benefits etc. However, the company hasn't been able to make any concrete progress. Instead of deciding on a useful structure for raises, they just announced a 4% pay raise for 2022. When the CEO was asked about whether that will be increase, considering the large inflation rate (6%-7%) in 2021, they said they wouldn't be doing anything different. 

- Poor project management
 Last year, the cloud team was tasked with the job of preparing us for HITRUST audit. For the majority of this project, we had shifting leadership on the team (first no team manager, to having a director step into a manager position, to promoting a manager internally, to having him leave and having the director manage again, to the manager who just left returning). We also didn't have any team experience on how to do HITRUST. The team worked very, very hard to meet a deadline that was arbitrarily chosen by some level up upper management. However, even when the team lost two people, the deadline didn't change. Afterwards, when the team had a retro about how we could have improved this project, when our take-aways were presented to upper management, nothing was really done about it. In short, there's really no way for engineers to really pass concerns up to management and ever see any change from it.

Nice people

Internet stipend","I feel duped and wish I had listened to my gut during the interview process. 

I had some red flags during my interviews. They couldn‚Äôt answer specifics about company direction or long term strategy, but I assumed it was because it was confidential and I would learn once I started. There also seemed to be conflicting answers from my panel about what we were working on, which I should have paid more attention to. Turns out it was because we have no clue what we‚Äôre prioritizing. The one executive who interviewed me was all talk, and I fell for it. 

We are generic. There‚Äôs no real differentiator to us, so it‚Äôs hard to sell to clients. Hyper obsessed with competition without a tangible plan to address this. 

No clue what the bigger goal is. They say ‚Äúmental health‚Äù a lot but no further details. Lots of jargon and words thrown out without meaning. So much talk, very little action.

Everyone seems very burnt out, but nothing is being done about it. Management blames us for being disengaged, for not speaking up in meetings, for not asking questions. Everything is ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt you more like this‚Äù while they sit on their perches and do nothing. The only people I‚Äôve seen promoted in the last 8+ months are those who just say yes to everything. 

So many new ‚Äúleaders‚Äù. They all try to connect with us by oversharing personal details during scripted introductions at weekly company Town Halls. But when you‚Äôre in meetings, it‚Äôs clear how cold they are. Most are inexperienced and overcorrect by micromanaging. Others just talk a lot but have contributed nothing meaningful. Not sure anyone is actually steering the ship. 

We‚Äôre bleeding. Lots of departures recently. Management never addresses questions about why attrition is so high. They seem to skirt around the question when asked or give some completely unrelated answer. 

Every week someone else is leaving but there‚Äôs no communication about it, so you just find out when you try to Slack them and their account is deactivated.

- the concept of every other week mental health days off is nice in theory... unless the executives schedule meetings on those days or give you last min. work with no lead time so you can't actually take those days off","Here's the real talk from someone who's been here many years and LOVES the product, loves the founders and loves the company‚Äôs mission: the changes in the last couple years have made even me (a Headspace super fan) question whether or not I can stay here. This company has lost all sense of decency and purpose to its employees and customers.

The short story is that there is horrible new leadership, scatterbrained and constantly changing priorities, no strategy (just reacting to whatever Calm is doing) so it's a chaotic work environment where they don't give you the support you need to do your job while they constantly add more work to your list, don't pay you more, while they keep telling you how important their employees are and how the mission is to improve the health and happiness of the world...as if that is a good reason to exploit their workers. 

If you want the full story...

This is a business and no workplace is perfect. You can't expect headspace to be zen just because it's a meditation company. Work stress will exist, but the problem is that bad leadership and bad business practices are resulting in more chaos and work stress than is necessary...they are creating needless fires to put out constantly. And it's wasted effort because we're not actually meeting business goals (which change constantly) AND we're not even focusing on customer needs (we're only focusing on random executive whims...based on no data or strategy). We are pretending that we're still an early stage start up and using that as an excuse to cover all the ineffective/inefficient and toxic business practices that we're too old and too established of a company to still be engaging in.

Headspace punishes competent people. If you want to succeed here, don‚Äôt be good at your job. In fact, don‚Äôt actually DO your job. Just tell other people to do your job for you. Leadership has no concept of what different departments do. So incompetent people/teams get a pass and their people get promoted as long as they keep saying yes to every shiny new object the leadership team wants to fixate on. And they love to run at new, conflicting projects all the time. Oftentimes in the middle of an existing project! And they won‚Äôt give you guidance or clarity on roles or expectations. There‚Äôs so much incompetent business practices, misalignment and wasted effort here. And leaders will blame you or go back on things they approved when it doesn‚Äôt go well. So the motivated, competent people get overloaded and burned out cleaning up other teams‚Äô messes repeatedly. ¬†

There‚Äôs been a wave of middle- and lower-level managers who have quit (we've been losing talent over the last year) and many were actually running headspace behind the scenes and not getting much credit for it. The work they were responsible for is now pushed to those of us left behind and I‚Äôm seeing now how difficult it was to keep meeting unclear expectations without any support. Burnout is guaranteed. 

The toxicity starts at the top. In the last year, the new CEO brought in her c-suite of ‚Äúyes people‚Äù who don‚Äôt actually have any understanding of how the product works or how to lead people (and have made no effort to learn). When we listen to her talk, it‚Äôs obvious she has no idea about the company‚Äôs approach to mindfulness or even what we offer on the app. she never interacts with the product team. We haven‚Äôt had a CTO since last summer. CEO likes to talk about being data driven and using AI/machine learning but our product doesn‚Äôt do what she‚Äôs talking about‚Äî and it won‚Äôt for a while. (From what I hear from others, she has a habit of speaking about topics that she doesn‚Äôt actually live out or know enough about.) 

I've seen many examples of how she's built a culture of fear and doesn‚Äôt meaningfully interact with teams, so my experience isn't an isolated incident. She puts on a kind show during our company all-hands but in the actual day-to-day, she didn't make an effort to understand different teams, get to know their pain points and opportunities.¬†I really wanted to give her a chance and see her succeed. but it‚Äôs been over a year of this bad leadership that's steadily getting worse.¬†It has trickled down into people at lower levels feeling pressured to meet unrealistic expectations which results in sloppy, rushed work that just creates more work to undo. ¬†

It certainly wasn‚Äôt perfect before the wave of Intuit leaders came. there were definitely some bullies here masquerading as mindful leaders but some have left the company and one of them just moved home abroad. But at least a few years ago it felt like leaders were genuinely working toward improving the product for our customers. The new leaders who joined haven‚Äôt taken the time to understand our people, our product or our audience. So they‚Äôre bumbling around shouting orders based on no strategy with no accountability and not setting teams up for success.¬†

Leaders change their minds about things they previously approved. And you‚Äôll find out through the grapevine because they won‚Äôt tell you directly and they won't even be clear about why changes/decisions are made so you can't figure out what you could do to improve.. Some people get unwarranted promotions while others who produce great work are bizarrely demoted.¬†

The company is now focusing solely on growing and appeasing investors (which I understand), but it‚Äôs completely confusing because the strategies are bizarre and inconsistently applied and at odds with the company‚Äôs stated values. Leaders are so butthurt about Calm‚Äôs success and trying to copy everything Calm is doing (but doing it so innefficiently and ineffectively).¬†Are we a mindfulness company? A meditation app? Entertainment/content? Health? Wellness? Who's our audience? Who are our competitors? Ask a different leader, you'll get different answers. That's because we don't actually know who we are anymore.

Attrition is high. They keep saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for a fast-growing company. They‚Äôve been using that excuse for almost a decade. But Headspace is not a new company anymore and you can‚Äôt keep hiding behind that excuse to justify bad business practices. 

Teams don‚Äôt know what we do/don‚Äôt have budget for because annual planning is a joke.¬†And if you want growth and development opportunities, you won‚Äôt find it here. No growth or career development prospects (unless you're one of Cece's friends from Intuit). They do employee surveys and we keep telling them the same feedback every six months. Nothing changes. It‚Äôs all just a show to make it seem like they‚Äôre listening.¬†

Managers at all levels of the company leave quickly (most barely last a year) so you‚Äôll be stuck in an endless loop of having to prove your value to a revolving door of VPs and C-suite leaders that the new CEO is connected to . We used to have a chief business officer ‚Äî she lasted about 6 months. But don't worry, we have an old colleague of the CEO ready to step in! Our B2B team structure changes every couple months. It‚Äôs unclear who does what. We used to have a VP of marketing who was great. Left after about 10 months. But we've got a new CMO now and don't worry, this time things will be different! (sure, sure)

Many of the¬†new leaders coming in don‚Äôt even go through a formal hiring process. We just all of a sudden get a memo about a new c-suite leader and I wonder why (even though we say we want a diversity of people and perspectives) we never even opened up the job to a variety of applicants beyond Cece's connections. It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt actually want to open up the pool to talented people. They just want people who‚Äôll agree with them.¬†

There are a few (and I mean a FEW) fantastic people at the c-suite level, and the founders Andy and Rich are great. but they are the exception to the rule. And there‚Äôs only so much that a few good people can do when the toxicity from the majority has trickled down into all levels across all depts.¬†

HR is nice but oblivious to the reality that other teams don‚Äôt function in the rose-tinted world they do. The ‚Äúunlimited PTO‚Äù is a joke. There's too much work to do that if you try to take PTO, you'll be punished for it by having to do extra work when you come back because now you have to undo the shoddy work they did while you were out. They just hired a couple diversity directors and that‚Äôs been a good move but many leaders here aren‚Äôt taking the importance of diversity upon themselves. they think that all they have to do to be an ally is just attend a training or say that they‚Äôre ""learning,"" and make sure we have a diversity person as part of our headcount so they can make that person do all the work on behalf of the company.¬†Or pass off the work to a few leaders at the company who were willing to shoulder the burden for everyone else. But a few of those leaders have left now too...

They have one leader on the c-suite team who joined the company (also one of Cece's connections from Intuit) and it feels like they're using her as ""proof"" that they care about diversity. Immediately after she was hired, she started talking about how diversity matters at headspace which was weird because she was brand new and hadn't actually had time to understand the state of diversity at Headspace. But it seemed like the fact that she was handpicked from Intuit to replace a former leader (who also left after barely a year here) might have incentivized her to say good things about Headspace's diversity efforts, even though she didn't know anything about our experience as people who weren't brought on from Intuit (and don't have her title+salary). I really hope they're not going to continue to point to her as proof that they care about diversity because that's just another mask for deeper problems. And she deserves better than that. All of us on the team deserve better than that.

Headspace,The bad immensely outweighs the good,1.0,"- Lovely group of people to work with on the day-to-day 
- Every other Friday off (tbd if this continues) 
- Benefits","Intuit Executives: Too many people from the same background and industry - lack of diversity in experiences, disregard for Headspace company culture, no vision, creating a steep, hierarchical organization. They hold control, but they have proven to not be leaders. 

Career Path: There is no path. You work hard and unless you‚Äôre a squeaky wheel that has excessively managed up to executives or you threaten to quit with a competing offer, hard work is not rewarded. 

Chaos: The constant executive strategy pivots, reorgs, attrition, secrecy and lack of communication have left teams exhausted and unfulfilled. 

Prioritization: Short term wins are constantly prioritized at the expense of long term strategy

If you‚Äôre considering joining Headspace and looking for more than opinions, here are some stats/facts. 

- The VPs of Product, Marketing, Design, Technology, People, and B2B have all quit or been fired in the last year. 
- Glint: Lowest rated areas of the company, Decision Making, Communication, and Performance Evaluation.
- Employees can only work remotely from Georgia, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, California, Washington, Maryland, and New York. BUT if you are an executive you may get special treatment (Illinois or international move to London).

ihorizon,"Work hard, Play hard - get rewarded!",4.0,"ihorizon was my first proper accounting gig. I left the company last year with amazing experiences accompanied with a sheer load of financial and non-financial skills. With the right attitude, you can learn, experience and accumulate a variety of skills too.
1. If you are a junior member of the team, you get a wide range of exposure to different parts of your client's finance function. Your work is hard but you acquire and accumulate good ground experience.
2. If you are a senior member you get given more extensive responsibility. You will need to step up to it - once you step up to whats on offer and tackle whats thrown your way - you come out the other side with a world of financial and accounting knowledge (for SMEs).
3. If you are a portfolio/business accountant and lead your own team, you will be tested on your adaptiveness, organisation and people skills - as well as accounting knowledge - these skills, have been vital to my growth.
4. I am still friends with people I worked with. That says a lot, ihorizon will go out of its way to make you feel at ease.
5. ihorizon hands down provides top-notch service to its clients and this is coming from someone who had to deal with other accountancy firms as a client. To be a part of ih helped me to develop another vital skill - to interpret financial data to non-financial people!
6. Great all around knowledge from CEO and Tax partner - who are very hands on and which means you will learn a lot!","1. This is not your typical accountancy firm! Understand this!
It is important that you take this is onboard before you start.... an unconventional approach like this is new and takes time and likely minded people for it to be a success - this means there will be trial and errors, a certain shift in operation, sometimes high workload etc.
You have to see the bigger picture and what the company is trying to achieve.
2. You hit the ceiling. You reach a certain stage where organic growth within the firms slows down (4 years+). If the company grows, which it is, this issue will no longer be a problem.
3. ih is still a young company and management are young as well. You will have to have a startup/SME mindset in order to understand and be adaptive to their management style. Its all about teamwork and having a business mindset.",15 Jul 2018 - Business Accountant
ihorizon,Avoid at all costs,1.0,"Sounds great from the outside in but, see below","Company is very badly managed and often left to one director, while the other two are either out of the office or too busy. Staff morale is incredibly low most of the time, flexi hours recently introduced to stem the flow of people leaving due to the poor work/life balance but once the novelty wore off, we were back to where we were.

The Culture - they like to go on about their values (there is a shocking spray painting in the kitchen) and give rewards to staff who demonstrate them. The business is trying to pretend it is a start up - get real, its an accountancy practice! Just look at the website!

Teams are frequently overloaded on low paying clients that demand everything is done yesterday and staff are told to make it happen - regardless of what time they leave for the day. 

Employment practises are very strange - frequent walk outs of staff by senior management are commonplace. In my time, I've seen it happen to atleast 3 people and with a staff base of 40, that tells you everything you need to know.

The company does provide training support for us to pass our exams but this has to be repaid if you leave within 12 months. This is the only thing keeping alot of the staff here as they cannot afford to leave, as the costs would wipe out their salary for the month and with rent to pay, they just cant do it. Right now there are less than 5 qualified accountants in the whole practice with very little review work going on - I can say that I have learnt very little in my limited time here.

Salaries. No real banding on them at all - it all depends what you come into the business on. I've heard of FA's and SFA's on similar money, although the SFA's are senior. Don't bother asking for a payrise - somebody was offered ¬£100 after they had passed 4 exams in the last year! Pretty unheard of in a regular accountancy practice. 

The management have posted all the positive reviews here - a few staff were asked to do it but the uptake was so low, it was left to the marketing guy to post them.",28 Jun 2018 - Anonymous Employee

Kickstarter,A slowly sinking ship. Make your way to  a lifeboat.,1.0,"- The office is really nice.
- You don't need to commute to Manhattan. 
- The people are smart and creative.","- Perry Chen controls the company and the board and hires his friends to agree with him. 
- The company has an intense identity crisis. Perry desperately wants to be relevant in the eyes of his art world friends, but the reality is that people primarily use Kickstarter for games and gadgets. Nothing bothers Perry more than having to face the fact that he built a modern-day QVC.  As a result, little-to-no resources are put towards addressing real, systemic issues on the platform around fulfillment, fraud, etc., while a tremendous amount of time and effort is put towards maintaining our brand identity among artists, filmmakers, musicians, etc. Unfortunately, most of these people have already used the platform (or had friends that used the platform), realized that it mostly meant hitting their friends and family up for cash, and decided there was no point in using it again. Meanwhile, the people who really need and value the platform (entrepreneurs, game designers etc.) are largely neglected. 
- There is an immense amount of technical debt. The people who built the site are largely gone and documentation is poor. Highly opinionated engineers tried to enforce their personal standards (functional programming, microservices) but never stayed long enough to see any of these initiatives through to completion (or they got so frustrated that they gave up). As a result, the codebase is a collection of disparate individual styles - it's over-engineered and under-architected.
- Since most everyone who built the site has left, no one owns anything. There is constant bickering and political maneuvering to try and dump responsibilities off on other teams. 
- Employees are fired in a clandestine and non-transparent manner, without being given fair warning or any feedback on their performance. 
- The recruitment team shows little concern for diversity in senior leadership.",27 Sept 2018 - Software Engineer

For the first time, I feel like I have a career as opposed to ""a job."" I could list a bunch of perks as ""pros"" but many of them are already listed here. I think it is important to note that this is a company that is different, which has its challenges, but it is here for the right reasons. There is meaning in what we are working on as a team here and I feel fortunate to be a part of that team. I have grown tremendously and learned from a group of talented, creative people with amazingly diverse backgrounds and experiences.

Kickstarter,The best place to work,5.0,"The 2017 Best Places to Work announcement just went out, and when perusing the list, the only thing I kept thinking was that in fact, Kickstarter is a better place to work than any of the places on the list. Its true. Here are just 5 reasons why:

(1) This morning I walked in and my coworkers were gathered in the kitchen, listening to music and preparing a pancake breakfast for the rest of the staff. Just because. Also: This is not an atypical morning.

(2) Yesterday we had Dyson Airblade hand-dryers installed to help diminish our negative impact on the environment. There is currently a coat drive being organized by our operations team, and our annual holiday gifting event includes a charity component. These features are just few of many many more because Kickstarter is a public benefit corporation, and for us our bottom line is measure by our impact on society. Read more here: kickstarter.com/charter

(3) Its the end of the year so many folks are discussing how they spent their health and wellness stipends. Here's a list of things folks have told me: Ceramics classes, French and Spanish classes, Cooking classes, new musical instruments, museum memberships, attending professional conferences, buying books. On the wellness front folks have put money towards gym memberships, physical therapy, and yoga classes. A bunch of folks even tried out Soul Cycle together.

(4) Today is a Healthy Workplace Workshop, and earlier this year we had workshops on being an ally, public speaking and management. Many of us also have company sponsored management coaches.

(5) The building we work in is exceptional. It was build from green and healthy materials, and designed to be a place that people would love to be and could access for work or other creative endeavors 24/7. In addition to all the cooking mentioned above, we host a regular D&D game (and have a huge games library in our actual library), staff led film festivals and screenings, an annual musical recital and maker nights.","Kickstarter is committed to staying small. With under 150 employees we never seem to have enough resources to do all the things we need to do. This can be frustrating. On top of that, senior leadership seems to have a hard time staying focused and following through. This can negatively impact team morale. Overall, I don't think these problems are unique to Kickstarter.",13 Dec 2016 - Anonymous Employee
Kickstarter,Home,5.0,"Kickstarter's a home. The people I get to work alongside are compassionate, super sharp, and hold each other to high standards. Over the years I've had a chance to work next to some incredible creative people ‚Äî filmmakers, musicians, artists, authors, makers, poets, entrepreneurs.

Walk into work each morning and hundreds of new creative ideas have launched since the day before ‚Äî you get to play a cameo role in helping them come to life. That's a pretty great feeling. 

The founders reincorporated the company as a public benefit corporation. Through that they set a number of longterm commitments that orient the team towards working for a more creative and equitable world. It can feel like a huge responsibility, but it's also incredibly motivating. 

I keep learning. Each year I look back and I had the chance to work on something that pushed me out of my comfort zone. And there's a whole culture learning from one another. Many colleagues devote time to teaching in-house courses. And the education stipend is flexible and an invitation to push yourself in new directions.

The physical space is beautiful. Like really nice.","We're tiny. Just 120 people. Our ambitions are much bigger. Sometimes it's painful to not be able to get to everything or to work as quickly as we'd like. 

We've hired a lot over the last year or two and it's hard to find the time to meet everyone and spend time with one another beyond projects. But there are built in opportunities for this pretty regularly ‚Äî companywide lunches, events, off-sites, retreats, etc. 

Like any startup things can change quickly. Sometimes the quickness can be overwhelming. Other times exhilarating. 

Everyone knows way more about every corner of creative culture than me in a way that's a little intimidating.

MRL Consulting Group,MRL keeps getting better and better,5.0,"I joined the company in 2016.  That's not a massively long time ago. Since I joined I have witnessed sheer brilliance when it comes to the vision of how to encourage, nurture and empower people to go the extra mile by actually looking after them and not just talking about it. So in 2017 the one month sabbatical after 5 years service was announced. That was very well received. I didn't think it could get any better but BOOM. In 2019 at the company sales year kick-off in Barcelona the CEO announces that we are moving to a 4 day week. A 4 DAY WEEK!!! No more having to dip out of the working day for doctors, dentist, plumber, car servicing, haircut, Amazon delivery. That can all happen on Friday's. The 4 day working week will be intense but come on, we all work 24/7/365 in this industry anyway, such is the drive to WIN. So Thursday night is now our new Friday night.

MRL strongly believe in rewarding their staff, so if you are willing to put in the graft and work hard, you will soon reap the rewards!

There are no hardline KPI's, you just need to work hard and do your best. There's a great social life and the chance of trips away, too.

What I enjoy most is how every employees tend to give their best without being pushed by an ""aggressive"" management and in the meanwhile having fun, rewards and a corporate management team that always tries questioning the way we do to be more optimal, to bring new ideas reward and fun.
Take this initiative of having one month given after 5 years passed in the company (and MRL takes 1200‚Ç¨ for a flight wherever you want). In this recruitment sector, I do not know much companies (if not) that deliver this kind of ""extra""...
Also, It has been and still be to me an excellent company to be a great recruiter or at least enjoy what I do on a daily basis...

This has allowed me to train up new staff and refine current processes.
On top of that, I have built a solid group of friends that I work very well with. David Stone and Kelly Robertson have been fantastic mentors to me and have taught me a lot. If anyone is looking for a recruitment company that offers amazing perks and a really nice environment, I‚Äôd highly recommend MRL.",My only con would be that I wake up regulary on a Saturday morning with a hangover!,1 Jun 2017 - Administrator
MRL Consulting Group,Excellent from top to bottom,5.0,"I worked for MRL for just under a year and I have to say it was the most enjoyable of my working life. 

I live 40 miles from Brighton so I had a hefty commute into the office by train every day using Sothern rail (don‚Äôt get me started on those clowns)  

MRL is a democracy, no one consultant is more important than another with a genuine togetherness that is completely unique. 

They have no egos within the business yet remain highly driven and professional as they have David Stone who they can trust to do the best by them.  

David is a brilliant person and boss, he has a way of installing self belief in his consultants and will always offer support and understanding while being honest with them at the same time.

MRL Consulting Group,Brought me in to the world of recruitment!,5.0,"I originally started in the graduate academy with no previous recruitment (or even sales!) experience. The academy provided a healthy mixture of classroom based theory and practical modules which developed a solid foundation and skill set in both traditional and modern headhunting techniques.

Going through an individual training plan to become an Account Manager allowed me to focus on key strengths of managing complex accounts across multiple territories. This in turn has resulted in me becoming one the company‚Äôs top performers.

In my opinion MRL provides a unique, mature and highly productive environment to work in. Enabling the best possible results through individual support in a fun yet challenging work environment.","Not many (if any) come to mind!

MRL Consulting Group,What a fantastic place to work,5.0,"Work hard and the rewards will come to you.  But from day one you get rewarded very well.  A great salary for the geographical area, pension, free health care and I have travelled across Europe, Middle East and Asia too.  
The little things in life matter and when you get recognised for the hard work you put in as I have, it makes a great job that much more enjoyable.  (Along with the free fruit, great coffee and fantastic facilities)

MRL Consulting Group,"Working at MRL, long-term employment experience",5.0,"I have been working at MRL for almost six years now and am still loving my job here. It's evident that we work as a big, but close team - no one is singled out. Every one receives support, friendship and understanding not just from the management, but from all employees.

Some reviews really are a shame on here and in my opinion completely inaccurate. I have never experienced any inappropriate, sexist or uncomfortable behaviour, nor have I ever witnessed such here. Quite frankly if that were the case, a company would not be thriving with the same CEO since 1997!

During my first year here I was offered the chance to complete NVQ's to help me progress in my career whilst working full-time which is a great benefit for a younger employee, now five years on I am seeing my colleagues being offered the same course options and support from management, it's a great additional benefit and shows that MRL really values us being long-term employees.

I am due to leave on maternity this year and the support I have been given from our CEO since the beginning and the options regarding returning to work have been great, I know I can come back when I'm ready and return to a great place of work.",MRL as a company - none,22 Jun 2016 - Administrative
MRL Consulting Group,Highly recommend!,4.0,"MRL offers some excellent benefits from remuneration and commission to location and working environment, it has it all!

This is not your standard recruitment firm, it's not heavy handed, overly high-pressured or sexist. My experience is that you can learn about real recruitment in a supportive and enjoyable environment. Occasionally things get pressured towards the end of a month/quarter but it's sales at the end of the day!

I've enjoyed working for MRL and have always been given support, encouragement and free reign to do new things.","Fairly long working hours, but you get out what you put in.

MRL Consulting Group,Chief Executive / David Stone,5.0,"I am the co-founder and Chief Executive of MRL.  Of course I'm going to say we're a wonderful company and that it's a great place to work - it's my job to do this!  And, in all honesty, I think it is, too.  I work hard to maintain a great, supportive working environment, provide fantastic remuneration / benefits packages and to look after my people.  I have a mantra that I live by - ""I look after my people, and my people look after me"" - but here's the hook, it starts with me looking after them, first.  And I mean that.
As part of any interview process I encourage applicants to quiz my colleagues, both experienced and junior, about what it's really like to work here.  No tricks, no fibs and no gimmicks or spin - transparency is extremely important to me.","I'm only human and I don't always get it right - I make mistakes.
But I'll always learn from them - isn't that how we improve?  And I tell all new joiners - it's fine to make mistakes - honestly - just don't make the same one twice!
Recruitment isn't for everyone - it's a tough job with plenty of pressure some stress on occasion.  It's not for everyone.  You need a fast brain, a big memory and a massive work ethic.
Plenty of people think they like the idea of recruitment, but when push comes to shove they either don't have the mental horsepower or work ethic for it.  And, try as I might, I can't train for ""attitude"".
But we don't take ourselves too seriously, have a lot of fun and the best people make a lot of money whilst delighting clients and candidates alike.

PDQ.com,Strong Benefits Package But Weak and Rocky Future,2.0,"Strong benefits package and a four-day work week.

During my time here, it was a great place to build a strong start of an early career. I don't know if that is still the case; I feel like it won't be, at least not to the level it was for myself.

Also, during my time there, the people were fantastic! But, with the new management I also feel that the culture is changing. Not so much to a bad one but more like plain yogurt. It's not bad but you wish it wasn't so milquetoast and had some sort of spice to it. The remnants of the old culture are there but are dwindling due attrition.

TL;DR If a job is just a job for you, PDQ is going to be awesome. The benefits package is fantastic here! Compensation isn't so strong but that might be okay for you.","The expertise is gone; the teams that build PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory are gone, everyone working on them now is new and does not have industry experience with system administration. It's the blind leading the blind.

The recent acquisition of SmartDeploy and SimpleMDM feel aimless, without any goal aside from the thrill of acquisition. I hope the teams who were acquired got some sort of golden handcuffs otherwise I hope they move on.

About a year ago there were mass layoffs that I see as a massive brain drain of PDQ talent, lots of industry expertise was let go and nothing has been done so far to compensate to that. To be clear, people have been hired but no one with expertise in the target market. I fear that the new management has taken the replaceable cogs mentality: a developer is a developer is a developer and their background knowledge of the target market is unimportant. Many of those on the engineering side have never dealt with system administration before and their efforts so far reveal that plainly.

TL;DR In my opinion PDQ is a company that has no plans for the future and no spark of creativity to contribute to the industry. The company is an investment vehicle for TA Associates that offers really great benefits. They're unknowingly coasting off previous efforts and that really sucks, PDQ used to be something special.",21 Jun 2022 - DevOps Lead

PDQ.com,Definitely... Legally... a place of employment,2.0,"* Free concert tickets to Vivint Arena 
* Good healthcare","For being a software company there is very little software development that actually takes place. The core goal of a software company should obviously be developing software and harboring a brain trust that enables the company to output better, more sophisticated, products. At PDQ there is strong resistance to actually doing the work necessary to keep the products relevant and future proof. During my career there it became clear that the management was too afraid to take the risks necessary to modernize the aging products, unless those risks were being undertaken by one of the founders who wrote much of the initial codebase. This problem leads to a myriad of cultural issues where developer input on problems was undervalued and in some cases was overridden by other teams that had no idea what they were talking about. Another issue is that there is a tremendous amount of 'god worship' around the codebase as it is, and a defensiveness around honestly assessing its quality.

PDQ still looks like a very young software company, but instead of being small and agile, it is already plagued by bureaucracy. They struggle tremendously with defining the problems they need developers to solve, and then are angry when the project takes too long and the output isn't what they wanted. Combine this with the fact that the development team is tiny, and it's easy to feel thrown under the bus and as if much of the company doesn't respect the dev team.

I think PDQ could someday be really cool if they got a strong CTO that understands that the core of a software development company resides in its development capabilities and strives to harbor that, even if it means addressing some very inconvenient truths.",16 Nov 2019 - Software Engineer

The ambitions of everyone are very high, every person is eager to grow personally and grow the product, but the stress is low. Building great things for millions of users with only 50 people means that everyone has to be contributing. Even the highest leaders are actively contributing things, which is great.

The core values of Piktochart are evident across the organization from top-bottom and is one of the aspects that I truly appreciate over the years of working in Piktochart. 

There is transparency in decisions that are being made for the organization and the co-founders of Piktochart have stuck to the core purpose of why they started Piktochart since day one.

Piktochart,Great people and working environment,4.0,"I've been working in Piktochart for 5 years, I feel very happy about my job so far.

I have a great work-life balance, I can work and rest at my own pace, there is no micro-management that needs you to complete your task by X time. The leaders trust me on how I do my work.

In addition to that, the company is fully remote, and has recently converted to a 4 day work week, which frees up more time to focus on learning. I spent plenty of time learning and exploring my other interests outside of work.

The team members are proactive in helping each other out, there are many times where they helped me in my work even though it is outside of their boundary. People are nice here.

The leadership team respects and understands the importance of craft. There are many respectable senior engineering people here. They are also up to date with the latest (stable) technologies. I found myself poking around different code bases and learnt a lot from it.","As Piktochart is a small and bootstrapped company, there are few cons associated with it.

The company is staying small and flat. If you are the kind of person that is motivated by promotion. Then Piktochart might not be suitable for you. Promotions are reflected in salary adjustment, not by title. Though it is quite unclear on how it is being adjusted. 

For business direction, the concreteness, soundness and clarity are weak. The company is trying out different stuff and is eagerly to find its footing again in the market, though the product is still profitable, but it is still far from greatness. The company needs time to figure out its direction, hence if you prefer to work in an unambiguous environment, you might not be happy at the moment.

Although people are nice to each other, there is also a tendency of withholding feedback and lacking debate / discussion. The people here, especially the engineers, are not very well versed in holding a discussion.

Finally, it is a comfortable environment, if you're not careful, it is very easy to fall into the comfort zone . Learning is pretty much a self-motivated activity, there are people that thrive here because they are disciplined in using the extra free time in their learning, there are also people who prefer to just breeze through the days.

Piktochart,"Comfortable, yet incompetent kindergarten",1.0,"Great work/life balance, very flexible working hours. 

Comfortable environment for those who prefer easy work, instead of a challenging environment that fosters personal growth. Expectations of employees are very low, it's smooth sailing.

Apparently good compensation and benefits compared to local standards. (However, Piktochart competes globally. Compared to international standards their package is sub-par.)

For those looking for a family-friendly comfort zone, easy money (if not much) and regular childish team building, Piktochart is a good place to be.","Long story short: For anyone who cares about their personal growth and career development Piktochart is the worst place to be. There‚Äôs dozens of employees who work in the company for many years who haven‚Äôt developed skills beyond what would be considered junior in most other companies. Piktochart doesn‚Äôt understand how growth works ‚Äî both, in terms of people and business. The leaders have hardly any knowledge or experience how to build a product or run a company. Piktochart‚Äôs business success (and now dwindling cash resources) came from luck of being at the right place at the right time in a then strongly growing market segment. However, Piktochart proves incapable of navigating a changing environment around them. It‚Äôs a sinking ship with a naive culture that‚Äôs resistant to the drastic changes and hard decisions successful businesses have to make regularly.

In detail:

Lack of career opportunities: It‚Äôs a small company, so naturally there are limited career opportunities within. Promotions are delayed for employees who skilled up and are deserving a more senior title (and pay).

Lack of growth: The team is quite inexperienced, even most of the ‚Äòsenior‚Äô employees and managers. This overall low experience level makes it very challenging to develop skills from within eg. by observing and learning from senior colleagues. Every employee has a budget for personal development, however it‚Äôs so tiny that it can‚Äôt move the needle much.

Personal connections over excellence: You‚Äôre mostly getting evaluated against how likeable you are. Achievements matter very little, quite the opposite: Exceptionally good people are often told to hold back their ideas, because it could intimidate others. At Pikto it‚Äôs less important how good your idea is, what matters more is how much support an idea has from everyone. Substance is secondary, connections and style are everything.

Values are only lived when they‚Äôre convenient for the founders. One example of many: We had to significantly change the role of a long-term employee. She was not interested in the new requirements and we couldn‚Äôt find another suitable role, so unfortunately we had to let her go. However Piktochart didn‚Äôt pay her the redundancy amount she was legally entitled to for her many years of service. Pikto only offered half of that and pressured her into accepting, knowing full well and exploiting the introvert nature of the employee in question.

Diversity is lacking: On the one hand Piktochart has great diversity in terms of gender and nationalities. However, there‚Äôs little diversity of opinion. The ‚Äòculture fit‚Äô of all employees is very important for the founder and strongly enforced. In practice, ‚Äòculture fit‚Äô means to be and behave as much like the founder as possible. 
For the founder unity and uniformity are sacred. Instead of creating a culture that embraces the benefits of intense debate, that can turn a broad set of perspectives and experiences into truly innovative ideas, she prefers a conflict-free journey which unfortunately only leads to mediocre outcomes. Intellectual diversity gets limited from the get-go when hiring and firing. Pikto doesn‚Äôt want the smartest people in their team. Equality is prime, being ‚Äòoutstanding‚Äô doesn‚Äôt fit in with this. 
Pikto‚Äôs misguided equality-cult goes so far that I actually got criticised for praising coworkers who do a great job ‚Äî because I did not complement everyone equally (including the ones who didn‚Äôt perform well).

The environment is childish ‚Äî from the way you‚Äôre forced to express yourself, to Zoom-team-events playing games you would with your little children. It feels like being in a kindergarten, instead of among adults trying to build something amazing together.

The team ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt care‚Äô: In an engaged organisation employees would be excited about the product and their market. Employees would come together by themselves bouncing ideas, discussing trends, etc. Not so at Pikto. Ideas don‚Äôt happen, innovation is expected top down. Many have given up and just do what they‚Äôre told to do.

Lack of direction: Pikto is surely not a mission/vision driven company, which is reflected in how often those are changing and hardly any employee being able to state them. ‚Äî If you don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre trying to achieve together, how can that possibly lead to sustained success? 

The CEO doesn‚Äôt understand her role: She‚Äôs only interested in the culture aspect of the organisation. The result is a neglected product, lack of a coherent strategy (Pikto has a little bit of ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô, that randomly changes around every quarter) and even lack of investing in the growth of the team.
She only ‚Äôtrusts‚Äô her team if she happens to believe the same thing. If her personal experience or opinion differs, no matter how solid the evidence against it, she will often decide her way against the experts she hired. She has to experience everything herself before willing to commit to anything, neglecting that customers might think differently. Her decision making can be erratic, often heavily influenced by the last thing she read or the last person she talked to.

Usually one says the experience gained working one year at a startup equals many years in a traditional company. At Piktochart it‚Äôs quite the opposite. Piktochart is not a startup, at best it‚Äôs a badly run, inexperienced, small business just muddling through. Therefore for most, a year spent at Pikto is more of a long holiday than career progress. (One colleague literally told me they were exhausted from previous jobs and enjoyed the easy life at Pikto, but would leave after a short while to find challenging work again ‚Äî and they did.)",9 Jan 2021 - Manager

To make matters even worse, leadership refuses to take accountability and listen to feedback to make the agency better. Instead they do a rebrand every other year and label all former employees as ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù who needed to go.

Praytell,I expected more,2.0,There really are some wildly talented and genuinely kind people here. I've made a handful of friends/connections that I'm so grateful for.,"Let's start with staffing‚Äîthe number one issue across the agency. On the creative side, Praytell is bringing in more work than the team has capacity for. My colleagues and I *consistently* raised flags regarding how thin we were stretched, and each time we were met with the promise that they were searching for more talent‚Äîbut this promise spanned 6 months with no new hires, and little effort to bring in freelance/contractor help. (Meanwhile, we were actively losing more full time creatives.) Additionally, our project manager went *above and beyond* to advocate for our time, but ultimately their efforts were dismissed by higher management. 

This leads me to the creative work. Because we were so desperately overstretched with creative production, there was little room for brainstorming, trial and error, experimentation, etc.‚Äîall things that are essential to good creative work. It was a constant churn and burn‚Äîalways a game of catch up. Consequentially, there wasn't much opportunity for creative growth, especially for junior/mid-level designers. Praytell is skilled at winning cool/notable clients, but they consistently handed those projects off entirely to freelancers or director-level creatives, leaving the rest of us with repetitive retainer work. I understand the need for these accounts for business, but allocating your entire team to redundant monthly social content is a fast track to burnout and mediocre work. Additionally, because director-level creatives were so slammed with these projects, they rarely had time to invest in us as a team and help make our work better.

When it comes to account management, Praytell has no backbone. Saying yes to every request that comes in from the client is not a sustainable business model. As a mid-level designer, it should not have fallen on me to say no to the client. Account management rarely stepped in to mediate or help figure out a path forward when client requests were unrealistic. This was the final straw for me.

Diversity / Inclusion - Praytell means well. But it's not enough. It's a classic case of diversity at the bottom and white men at the top. I saw first-hand how my colleagues (who were neither white, nor men) persistently advocated for promotions/raises, only to be met with empty promises. Meanwhile, select men were promoted during a supposed ""agency-wide promotion freeze"". (One of whom has been repeatedly reported for misogynistic and racist comments/actions‚Äîanother nail in the coffin for me.) The ERGs are a good resource for community within Praytell, but ultimately I did not feel they had any influence in the professional/business side of things. 

Benefits are good on the surface, but are difficult to use in practice. PTO (while unlimited) is difficult to use when teams are so thinly stretched. And the 4 day work week (a trial run during my time there) doesn't work when account management can't set clear boundaries with the client on behalf of their teams.

Praytell,An amazing agency with people who truly care,5.0,"I have worked at Praytell since nearly the beginning and have seen the agency grow from around 10 people to more than 150 and even on stressful days and during the inevitable growing pains, I know a good thing when I see it.

Praytell,Sinking Ship,1.0,"PACT (DE&I) team is very ahead of the curve in its internal and external offerings

Client presence in many verticals makes Praytell a decent early-career agency job if you are looking to gain experience (this is also a con above the junior level)

Agency used to attract creative, thoughtful individuals","Praytell leans heavily on projecting a crafted image as a full-service industry disruptor that started as a PR shop. Yet most teams lack the resources, headcount, and systems and processes to do this. Management has tried to pass this off as a result of the ""great resignation"" but these issues existed before 2020. Rather than trying to fix the problems by implementing strategic hiring or paying employees a fair market rate, they shout louder about existing benefits or try to make it seem like employees didn't raise their hands enough to implement change.

Echoing recent sentiment that it's very sad to see what the agency has become. One of the most glaring issues is how mid-level (senior and supervisor) employees on the strategy, creative, and social teams are treated and allocated; every mid-level employee on the strategy team (including its sub-specialty teams) has quit over the past four months. This level of an employee was often expected to hold up entire specialty teams (paid media, analytics) by executing more senior work without being able to pass off more junior tasks, something that is common on the PR side. When my peers and I would flag that we needed support on our team, we were either reassured help would be on the way (it didn't) or that we weren't actually billing enough hours (it's hard to bill hours when integrated accounts overservice beyond their scope). It‚Äôs also nearly impossible to make a lateral move. Teammates who wanted to switch teams often faced massive roadblocks in their transitions or weren‚Äôt given the opportunity at all.

Agency pay is often lower than in-house, but Praytell's pay is low compared to other agencies. Leadership would also often try to rationalize low pay to individual employees by saying it was industry standard, but I was paid 20k below the median salary for someone with my years of experience, job title, and skills according to the 4A salary report (the one the agency uses to help determine pay). For me and many of my peers, we increased our salaries exponentially by leaving; leaving for a pay increase is obviously common but I'm emphasizing EXPONENTIAL growth.",11 Oct 2021 - Anonymous Employee

Like all start ups, there‚Äôs going to be a lot of change, a lot of growth pains, leadership changes and so on. I feel like Procurify finally has it figured out and is moving fast and efficiently into a new stage of Procurify. It‚Äôs a really exciting time to be a part of the company, especially for those looking for growth opportunities and to be apart of the changes that scaling up will bring. 

A BIG thing for me: A lot of companies are going to tell you they care about your mental health, your personal life, and your work life balance. I‚Äôve been at companies where they said they supported mental health, but ended up giving you a hard time for taking sick days and vacation time. I can promise you - Procurify actually means it. I‚Äôve been able to take mental health and sick days when needed and manager actively talks about burn out and making sure everyone‚Äôs health is taken care of. They also ENCOURAGE people to take time off, through their Responsible Time Off - I took a trip to Malaysia for 3 weeks during my first two years, and my request for time off was met with excitement by my manager - Who would have thought!? 

The remote working AND four day work week is a absolute godsend - having the flexibility of working from home allows me to balance my work life to the best it‚Äôs ever been, and the four day work week allows me to prioritize work and life throughout the week so I‚Äôm not choosing one or over the other.

Procurify,Best Place I Have Ever Worked  At x 100,5.0,"I can honestly say that this is the¬†best place¬†I have had the pleasure to work at,¬†and the main reason is because of the company and people that I work with.

I have been here a while and seen a lot of changes, as you would expect from a start up, and it's all trial and error. Some worked and some didn't, but having¬†the balls to try in order to make the company better is what it's all about.¬†

The fact that we have unlimited vacation days, a 4 day work week, a dog friendly office, a beer keg in the kitchen, a lot of gatherings¬†and parties, yeah it's all great and makes a perfect work life balance. However it's more than just that, as we have our core values within the company, for example being compassionate to each other, which makes for a perfect work environment also.¬†

Never have I worked for a company with such values that people aren't trying to jump over each other or stab each other in the back, but actually¬†trying to help everyone be better at their job, even if it means taking time out of their busy schedules¬†to help. Many times have I had a problem and needed some urgent help, with multiple team members dropping everything to help me out.","There may be some negative reviews in the past from past or current employees, but just like in every company it's normally those individuals who may have not be the best culture fit for the company and who may be a little bitter about leaving a pretty awesome place.¬†The company is trying to find the best people out there, and sometimes that means letting people go.

Yes there are always cons and crazy times in every company, otherwise it would be perfect all the damn time, and how boring would that be.

Not only that, but there seems to be a difference of work ethic between the business side and the engineering side. It feels like they're trying to build whatever is cool, as opposed to what the customer really needs or asking for. 

It just seems like we're trying to copy the innovative ideas from Silicon Valley without the actual skilled workers or good product.

Procurify,Collaborative culture and immense opportunity for growth given the right strategies!,4.0,"I've worked at Procurify for over 3 years and it was an invaluable experience to say the least. The personal and professional growth I've gained with this company has taken me very far.

1. The collaborative culture ‚Äì Everyone is willing to work together towards a common goal whether it is within CX or cross functionally and no one is afraid to jump on a call for support. This is one the biggest values at Procurify for me. I‚Äôm
always inspired by how hardworking and proactive team members are and it is all because of the collaborative culture.

2. Autonomy & Trust ‚Äì We are given a lot of opportunities to create projects, to build teams, to take on initiatives and to fail and try again. With changes like the 4 day work week, it goes to show how much time and care has been put in place in order for these decisions to come into effect. There is mutual trust that leadership has our best interest in mind and it is clear because of these actions taken during a difficult period of time.

3. Product & Market ‚Äì the user friendliness of our product is one of the biggest reasons we win over our competitors (besides being cost
effective). So I believe that if we are able to hone in on our target market and specialize in our solution with industry experts on core areas, there is a huge potential of growth for Procurify. We are filling an important gap/need in this
industry and with the proper expertise and direction, Procurify can be one of the common tech stacks for companies.","1. Clarity in direction ‚Äì Why have we chosen software companies as our target? Why have we done so many customizations for other clients that are not within our beachhead? There are many clients we‚Äôve taken on that are not a good fit for
us and they do not belong in our beachhead but we are spending months doing workarounds. Are we portraying ourselves as a spend
solution or procurement solution or AP solution? (I ask this because I don‚Äôt think it is clear to most people and there hasn‚Äôt been prioritization on those areas). If we want team alignment and a strong positioning in the market, I think it is an important line of questions to answer.

2. Cross functional alignment ‚Äì Often times, there is a discrepancy in prioritization between client needs (CX) and product features rolled out. At the end of the day, it is a battle between increasing revenue vs reducing churn. A lot of things we are focusing on helps the sales team sell to prospective clients as a new exciting feature but we overlook our existing client base, their satisfaction can lead to a promising revenue stream with minimal effort from us because they already love and need Procurify.

3. Capacity & Commitment ‚Äì I am most likely biased as I‚Äôve only been part of CX for the past 3 years. However, I think we need to put more effort in maintaining a healthy level of work capacity within CX. Team members may feel overwhelmed or burnt out. In addition, commitments should be executed as agreed upon whether it is about internal projects prioritized e.g onboarding or compensation. I have a lot of care and respect for leadership and the team so I want the best for everyone as a whole.",29 Jan 2021 - Senior Professional Services Consultant
Procurify,"Great people, right ideas, it's time to execute",4.0,"I worked at Procurify for almost 4 years across multiple teams. The people are some of the kindest, most genuine, and supporting individuals I've had the opportunity to work with.

No drama or double guessing when you need to take time off, as long as the work gets done. 4-day work weeks are legit, you're not expected to work on fridays, but of course if you're in a customer facing role you'll do what you need to do. 

The market demand for a product like Procurify is strong, and there's a lot of potential to grow rapidly with the right strategic product releases. 

Very flexible and open to moving roles and exploring your strengths to advance your career.","In the past, there was much indecision and lack of execution when it comes to Product releases. Projects tend to never get completed to an MVP, and it felt like customer feedback wouldn't be heard. This gave me the impression that Procurify may have missed some tremendous opportunity for growth.",27 Jan 2021 - Implementation Manager

- You could get to work on problems you feel passionate about.
- Teams are always open to try new things.
- You get to lead the execution of the designs you work on.
- Lots of integration events, a good environment to make friends.","- COVID was just an excuse for some departments to layoff people who had strong opinions about the product and cared about the customer, which tells a lot about the leadership culture given that they are aggressively hiring three months after the layoffs.
- Soo much tech debt that often prevents designers from innovation.
- For a Senior-level, you are expected to have an understanding of business to get buy-in from leadership. 
- It feels like you can only grow by polishing the right people's shoes.
- Procurify has been the first (and only) job for many engineers in the team. This often has an impact in terms of work ethics.
- The sense of urgency to deliver is not the same for everyone, some people are in the comfort zone.

Procurify,Experience as a Sales Rep at Procurify,3.0,"Procurify is a fun place to work, the team gets along, and effort to maintain a good culture is put in.

Good work/life balance - most sales staff work under 40 hours once you factor in long lunches and other ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù.","The company isn‚Äôt being run great, the software isn‚Äôt very competitive (lots of issues) making it a hard sell. Management makes questionable decisions (strategy, budgets etc). Compensation as a whole falls short of larger Van tech companies (some AE‚Äôs may crack 200k, but many make under 100 with no one hitting their quota), poor financial performance hinders job security, training is sub-par at best.

Since you‚Äôre encouraged to be open and honest from the beginning it makes it really easy to address challenges together. I think this is the biggest win. The minute you start becoming closed off is the moment that your employees start to close off, and feel less valued. At Procurify you really do feel like you‚Äôre building something together and your input is valueable.

I also feel like there is a lot of support to work on projects you are passionate about. They want everyone to feel like their fearless is learning and growing professionally and personally.","Nowhere you work will be perfect. If you think it will be then you will never be satisfied.

Procurify,A place you can really make an impact,5.0,"I've been part of the Procurify Team during a period of massive expansion and I've been impressed every step of the way at how dedicated, resilient, and passionate the people in this company are. Somehow, despite all the new faces, the changes, and the accelerated growth we have managed to maintain the culture that I joined the company for - one that values people from all walks of life, ideas no matter who they come from, and integrity - always.

It's a place that no matter what your 'title' is, you are never restricted to the confines of your job description. You can collaborate with any team member, work on projects you are passionate about, and you can bet that your teammates will be truly supportive, excited and invested in the work you're doing. I've never worked in a space where my ideas (no matter how outrageous) have always been well received, and backed by everyone on the team, regardless of their success (let's be real: not every idea is a great one haha).

This is a place for people who are excited to make a positive impact and aren't afraid to try something that's never been done before. It's a startup environment and with that, many people automatically think ping-pong tables, dog friendly spaces, beer on tap, and video games - don't get me wrong, we definitely have these things, but MORE IMPORTANTLY, we have grit, we have drive, and we have a team full of people who genuinely care about each other and the clients we work with. We are all here to find better ways to make work life the best it can be, and we're doing it one step at a time as one team rather than 90+ individuals.","It can be chaotic at times, and there will be days where it feels like you are running around with no idea where you are going and there are a lot of processes that need to be built out, or seriously re-evaluated (but that's half the fun of joining a startup.. the opportunity to build out processes and try things that any other company would be afraid to let you take a stab at - right!?)

We're new at this. A lot of the team is fresh into the spend culture/B2B/fintech space. With that you get a lot of amazing perspectives, but this is definitely a place where you need to be a go-getter and a self starter (cliches, I know). You will not have your hand held every step of the way, and you have to be willing to hold yourself to a standard and expectations.

Reflect Digital,Reflect Digital checks all the boxes,5.0,"I worked at Reflect Digital for over 3 years and had a great time for the duration. I find that attitudes in the workplace are always a reflection of the owner's attitudes and this shows in a positive way at Reflect. I found the company to be a fair, fun but most of all 'human' place to work and develop your skills. The owners have made efforts to build a 'people-centred' business, focussing on staff wellbeing with the 4 day work week (although this isn't compulsory). 

Usually, in a workplace, there is always 1 or 2 people that you may not necessarily be best of friends with, however, I can honestly say everyone I worked with at Reflect was a great person first and foremost as well as dedicated to making Reflect a great place to be. The social element of work is important for me and I do miss the Christmas parties and the office banter.

During my time here, I had two promotions, so career progression is achievable if that is your aim. Sadly, I left Reflect to start a new venture before the partnership with Lab and the move to a bigger and better office, but I've only heard stories of positive growth, new client wins and how cool the office is from former colleagues.  Would highly recommend.","Not a con at all but whilst the work-life balance is good and personal time is respected, this is a 'fast-paced' agency which was great for me, but not for those who want to coast with minimal effort!

It's also such a forward-thinking company to work for. Since joining in September 2019, Reflect Digital adopted a 4-day working week, which has been absolutely fantastic, it's allowed me to have time to do what I love outside of work and gain a better work-life balance. 

Each summer and Christmas, team building events are organised and we have regular team catch-ups throughout the year. 

The senior leadership team always have time for each team member and are so willing to listen and help.

* Extremely strong and bright co-founders that care about the people that work at the organization. Pre-pandemic when people were going to the office all of the VPs and managers sat on the main floor with their team. There were no offices, not even for the CEO who sat directly across from me. 
* Very approachable CEO and exec team. If you have an idea, suggestion, or feedback you can approach anyone in the leadership team and share it. They take feedback seriously and take action when necessary to address things. 
* You'll meet some of the coolest and smartest people who love what they do. I've made several lifelong friends while working at Signifyd. 
* Your impact is recognized and rewarded regardless of what department you work in, gender, race, or experience level. During my time I saw someone in every single department get recognized and rewarded for their contributions to the company. It didn't matter the position, office politics, or your department. If you do good work they notice.
* Everyone puts the customer first. It's a part of the company's DNA. There are no hidden agendas or office politics when this is embedded in your culture.","* Typical startup issues like growing pains and the need to wear multiple hats

There's transparency into department and company goals, feedback is highly encouraged and acted on, and the leadership team genuinely cares about the team. I appreciate the focus we have on wellness, continuous learning and development, and DEI in a way that feels authentic. The ERGs and People team have brought in external speakers and done internal panels on a variety of topics which have been so impactful. 

The four day work week shift has also made such a difference for me. I feel like my team has been really supportive of creating a healthy balance between work and personal time. While we're working through the kinks that come with such a big change, people are really good about sharing what's working and what's not and leaders are helping create more clarity. 

The benefits are great, but what I really love is the people.

* Extremely strong and bright co-founders that care about the people that work at the organization. Pre-pandemic when people were going to the office all of the VPs and managers sat on the main floor with their team. There were no offices, not even for the CEO who sat directly across from me. 
* Very approachable CEO and exec team. If you have an idea, suggestion, or feedback you can approach anyone in the leadership team and share it. They take feedback seriously and take action when necessary to address things. 
* You'll meet some of the coolest and smartest people who love what they do. I've made several lifelong friends while working at Signifyd. 
* Your impact is recognized and rewarded regardless of what department you work in, gender, race, or experience level. During my time I saw someone in every single department get recognized and rewarded for their contributions to the company. It didn't matter the position, office politics, or your department. If you do good work they notice.
* Everyone puts the customer first. It's a part of the company's DNA. There are no hidden agendas or office politics when this is embedded in your culture.","* Typical startup issues like growing pains and the need to wear multiple hats
* Depending on your role and your expertise in risk/fraud it can be a bit more difficult of a domain to master, however, folks are willing to help and teach you along the way.",16 Feb 2022 - Product Manager

Signifyd,I miss working at Signifyd,5.0,"It was amazing to see how much Signifyd grew during my four years working there, made possible by its excellent product and company culture.

Product:
-- Signifiyd is THE top company in the e-commerce fraud protection domain.
-- The market still has huge potential. Especially considering the pandemic has profoundly changed people's shopping habits.
-- Lots of interesting projects to work on.
-- Fighting and catching bad guys in real time gives employees (or at least gave me) the kind of satisfaction that's hard to see when working on other products.

Culture:
-- Signifyd cares a lot about employ's growth and wellbeing. Swags, fun events, you name it. Great work-life balance. It's on four-day workweek now since 2022 (I already left by then).
-- Everyone there is super kind and talented. The environment is supportive and encouraging, makes me feel like a family.
-- Great leadership proven by its achievements. Very transparent at company decisions. Cares about everyone's voice being heard.

There are still lots of opportunities for the company and its employees. I have no doubts in its future.","I personally don't take this as a con, but if you don't like rapid development (two week sprints, daily standups, etc.), you'll need a solution that works for you and your team.",8 Feb 2022 - Software Engineer

However, the pros are abundantly clear! The best reasons to work at Signifyd are, the company is inclusive, very friendly, incredibly supportive, and there is a shared common goal to scale the company! They are also brilliant at providing the flexibility that is needed to balance life and work! Not to mention the incredible swag and top of the range tech. I think it is also important to note that HR are incredibly active/engaged and always check in to see if there is any additional support they can give. To put this into context... it took me a year and a half at my old company to try and champion mental health initiatives within the business.

- HR team is one of the best I've ever seen. I really appreciated that even though we have unlimited PTO, they gave us additional 5-6? days off throughout the year for our mental wellness. It's like they're forcing us to shut down and recharge.
- Team culture probably varies, but my team leaders tend to do monthly fun events. They also send door dash gift cards on a regular basis, which I appreciate so much! 
- A lot of independence and little-handholding, but rest assure someone is always there to have your back when you need it.","- I started during the pandemic, so onboarding remote is not always fun.

Signifyd,"Do not work here if you are at all ""different""",1.0,"Your paycheck will arrive on time, but if they decide you do not fit into the mold of the kind of person they want you to be, they will drive you out with cruel comments and gaslighting.","This is one of those truly scary organizations that has a set of ""values"" (never mentioned again after the interview process) and an HR department with a Big Smile, that you quickly realize is really the wolf's jaws opening up for grandma the second you're in.  In other words, they talk a big game about diversity and inclusion, but the second you get there and you aren't like everyone else -- you will feel the pain. 

Let me be clear: Signifyd is not interested in hiring anyone in outside of the mold, and if you are too ""different"" (as they decide), you will not have a chance at succeeding in this organization.  Over 11 months, at both my reviews I was repeatedly told that although my work and management were both exemplary, and my systems updates incredibly helpful for the business - my personality  was the problem. I was told point blank that if I wanted to be successful at Signifyd I would have to (1) change my cadence of speaking (an immutable trait), (2) be ""less intense"" *as the most senior woman on my team this was particularly interesting* and (3) be ""more calm, quiet and measured."" 
 
It gets better. I was also told after working there only 4 months that I would need personality coaching on top of my already incredibly full workload, and specifically directed not to speak in ANY meetings ""until everyone else had already spoken.""  Seriously.  Since I was almost always in meetings with all other men, I guess they would rather have women speak last in meetings at Signifyd. 

After working hard for months to change my cadence, stay silent in meetings and generally be the demure female they wanted, I got more news.  Suddenly, there was a new urgent issue -- the COO told me:  ""You make the Founder nervous."" As anyone who has worked at a tech company knows, the founder not liking you is bad. So of course I asked why, why did I make him nervous? What had I done wrong? (For the record, the outside personality coach they made me go to said it was incredibly problematic that they even said this to me in any case - you can't make someone feel a certain way, and it's not exactly appropriate for a founder to say this about a female staff member at all)...  And guess what the answer was? They didn't have one! Over the next 6 months, I never ONCE got an answer or single explanation for why I ""made the Founder nervous"", despite only meeting him 4-5 times virtually in groups. He would never promote me, HR informed me with certainty. Not with my attitude! What attitude, I pleaded. They were silent. I was doing everything to change and more, and still killing it at my work (which you'd think would matter), so what was I doing wrong?  The  COO and an HR rep said they ""didn't want to litigate the situation"" and refused to ever give me any concrete reason.   

At my next review they said my work was incredible and my management going great, but I was just too different for Signifyd.  I was still ""too intense,"" my cadence still too sharp, I spoke too quickly and often, and I would never be as ""measured"" as they wanted.  Because of that, I would not succeed.  All their exact words.  I had failed and they were promoting someone over me.  Not because of my work, which was fabulous - they stressed.  You are the first person we would turn to in a crisis, the COO said! - But still, you're being demoted ... because of who you are as a person.  Huh?

It was horrible, honestly.  Not only being told you have a bad personality, but that you're being punished at work for it?  Can't that be the one place you just get to do your job?  Not if you're a woman at Signifyd.  And I am pretty sure that rule only goes one way, because, trust me, not every man running around there is a peach!

The truth is, Signifyd is not interested in hiring outside of the mold that already works there. Only certain kinds of women can get ahead. When I left, several women approached me to tell me that they had seen this over the years, and had the same experience themselves. They said there is only one way for any women to succeed with Signifyd execs: to be quiet, calm and demure. In other words, unless you are naturally that way all the time, if you're a woman at Signifyd, you can never really be yourself and succeed.   

One funny story. The same month this all happened, Signifyd put on a diversity seminar that explained that women are often judged unfairly on their personalities, whilst their stellar work performances are ignored (and men are judged on, of course, performance). I called HR to talk about this, as I felt this had happened to me. The rep literally laughed in my face and said: ""I don't agree with it in your case, in your case - your personality is the issue."" Well, when the HR department does not stand behind the diversity seminar you know you have a problem. The employees at Signifyd are sold a dream, but in the end of the day, if you act in any way outside of the mold, there is no one there to help you. And they will cut you down and denigrate you until you feel like a shell of your former self along the way. 

If you are at all different from the average Fintech Bro, stay far away from this organization. If you are an ""intense"" (whatever that means) female with a strong personality, don't put yourself though it. If you don't ""fit in"" the way they decide you should, they will make your life a living nightmare that you cannot escape until you quit. My advice, save yourself the therapy, keep your cadence as is and go work just about anywhere else. It ain't worth it.",21 Sept 2021 - Anonymous Employee

Had 2 1-2-1 meetings total in my first 3 months, felt disregarded from day 1 as was not given an account for almost 6 weeks. I was constantly told my work was not good enough by my manager and someone else would amend it, to find one sentence or a photo added to my work, which was insulting and clearly setting me up as junior. I constantly did large decks and bodies of work to be told 2 minutes before the call the work would be presented on my behalf by them. Being unprofessional at socials and sending emails regarging key development updates that should be verbally shared. Really unprofessional with no one having visibility on this relationship due to the pod structures.

The Curve Group,Excellent Company,5.0,"Clear management structure, excellent rates of pay, flexible working and supportive manager",None I can think of!,25 Apr 2022 - Recruitment Business Partner
The Curve Group,A company that goes above and beyond to put people first,5.0,"The Curve Group really are a fantastic company to work for, and I feel extremely fortunate to have found a job that I love in a company that I trust, believe in and that treat their employees like family.

The Curve Group put a lot of work into creating a working environment and culture where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.  There are monthly events such as team building exercises, socials and celebrations - and everyone is encouraged to suggest more.  

If there is something which you are passionate about, or that you think could be done better or differently, there is an openness to be heard and to really make a positive change.  Alongside this, the CEO is incredibly approachable.  We receive regular updates from her and I think every person in the business has her personal mobile number.  

The company never stays still, and is always looking to improve. This has meant there is a strong focus on CPD and upskilling, as well as a ‚Äòpromote from within‚Äô philosophy.  The company is fast paced and agile, but at the same time supports people with the tools, courses, workshops or qualifications required so they can do their job well. One of the things that I love about The Curve Group is that you‚Äôre not expected to have all of the answers, but instead they support and encourage you to continue to improve your skills and knowledge to fill in any gaps. 

The Curve Group isn‚Äôt like any other company I have worked for. They genuinely put their employee needs first. After maternity leave, The Curve Group offered me flexible working.  This has meant that I can be mum and continue to have a career, a life and a job that I love. This in itself has completely transformed my working and personal life.  To not have to choose between having a family or having a career, but in fact being able to have both makes me feel incredibly lucky - and it‚Äôs something which is extremely rare. 

However, The Curve Group really have gone above and beyond. Recently, I have had some serious health issues.  This has meant that the last month has been difficult - with various hospital appointments, isolating, childcare, upcoming surgery.  How The Curve Group and my Manager have responded to this has been phenomenal. They immediately said I could work from home, I have changed my hours so that I can better juggle working and watching my 18 month old, they have done everything possible so that I can focus on my own recovery. No request has been too much and I have never felt like I am letting them down. It has made a huge difference to me. 

Lastly, I couldn‚Äôt not include the fact that, at The Curve Group, the glass ceiling has been truly shattered. Quite simply, any person who wants to progress at The Curve Group, can.","The work load can be high and the benefits aren‚Äôt as good as previous companies that I‚Äôve worked for.  However, I know the organisation is currently looking at these issues and are bringing in a 35 hour working work (down from 40 hours) from May and currently are recruiting with the aim to over resource so that people‚Äôs workloads are reduced.",23 Apr 2022 - Marketing Executive
The Curve Group,An honest review of The Curve Group,5.0,"I've been with The Curve Group for over two years now and the negative reviews I've just read on Glassdoor must be describing somewhere else.

My time at the Curve Group has been nothing but positive and I feel valued and work for an organisation that genuinely cares and tries to include everyone.

Yes, the company is very busy at the moment, however, this is same across the entire economy from what I can tell. Extra hours are not expected and how can working one day p/w in the office and the rest from home be seen as anything other than flexible?

The Curve Group,Do not work for this organisation,1.0,Location of head office is rural,"Although promoting a strong ethical foundation, the organisation fails to uphold these values and follow ethical practice. The organisation prides themselves on being diverse and fair, however unfortunately these principles are not a true reflection of how the company is run. 

Additionally, whilst The Curve Group obtain regular clientele, this is done by engaging in unethical practice. Within the organisation, young and inexperienced employees are compelled to deliver targets that cannot be achieved due to the organisation overselling the capabilities of their teams to clients. The employees are often incentivised through the guarantee of a rewarding career however, this is not upheld. Furthermore, employees face highly demanding workloads, with an expectation of working long, unsociable hours of which the pay does not reflect. Employees do not have a sense of autonomy, and this not only applies to working hours, but also their appearance and conduct of themselves during client presentations. After employees have completed their responsibilities, they are disregarded and not supported with any change in their personal circumstances, although this is widely promoted throughout the company. Could add examples of what that might be? 

The Curve also promote themselves as a women led organisation, who support and empower females within the company. However, this is not reflected in their backing of pregnant women as there is no support offered to women who begin maternity leave. Furthermore, there have been several cases of gender pay discrimination, with male employees earning more than their female colleagues, who carry out the same roles.

I can certainly say, that the more ambition and drive that you put into your role to be the best and then deliver amazing things, then the more personally rewarding it becomes!

thredUP,"Fun for a few hours, Don't look for advancement",3.0,"Typical shift, i clock in, go to a station, and pack clothing into a box. The warehouse is huge, but mostly due to the inventory. Walkable floorspace is comparable to a Target. Training is not very organized, basically its whoever has been there longest explains what to do. They should streamline this.

There's music on, its a set playlist that corp picks, but some of its really explicit and not work appropriate so idk if thats true.You're not allowed to wear headphones, you can wear earplugs, no phones on floor. But the music does help in keeping you energized and productive.Most people keep to themselves.

They do use metrics, like how much you pack per hour, but its pretty easy to hit. They measure a few things, and you get a per'hr bonus check each month if you hit them, its easy money.

Diversity: During orientation, they show you a picture hierarchy of the company. It's super diverse on the floor, and gets less and less so the closer to the top it gets. Most of my management team is male.

Covid: masks are mandatory, theres a temp check at door.

There's a nice big breakroom, with a mini store with real, actual food you can buy at a kiosk. they keep coffee on, its a chill vibe. the call out policy is pretty easy to follow, with many ways to call out and options to make up that absence in the week and not lose your attendance bonus.

Theres a points reward system that you can use to recognize other workers, and they can spend those points on comp merch.

I applied to work the floor on a temp basis to see if i liked the fit. The company is very responsive to applications and the hiring process is clear. The interview process was quick and easy, they gave a tour of the site. They promote from within they say, but so far, new management has been hired from outside and trained on other shifts.
Management: the leads and supervisors are super nice, helpful and knowledgeable. There are occasional staff meetings where they inform of new company info. They often have fun little events for holidays, and the morale is good.

Bottom Line: Great warehouse job! Flexible hours, fast paced but not stressful - theres always work to do! Not the place to go if you're looking to advance or learn new skills though.

They won‚Äôt let you take a sabbatical on the growth marketing team which they only tell you after hitting the three year mark, your request will always get denied. Very demoralizing and draining.

The marketing team has the highest rate of burnout often working 6-7 days a week (even though they‚Äôll tell you it‚Äôs a 4 day work week).

Directors, critical engineers, even heads of departments in other sectors of the business get to take sabbaticals no problem, the oldest employees have even earned a second one.

There are unequal promotion practices. You‚Äôll see other parts of the org promoting annually whereas some areas like integrated marketing might be once every 2-3 years if you‚Äôre lucky.

For people with the gift of gab you can get promoted even if you‚Äôre full of hot air. If you‚Äôre a hard worker with less people skills you‚Äôll have limited success.

Treehouse,Livin' the dream,5.0,"Treehouse is a wonderful product and even better place to work at. As an Engineering Manager in the Portland office I had the opportunity to observe and interact with all levels of employees, and in all departments. I was included in the company wide layoffs, and if given the opportunity, I would without a doubt work at Treehouse again. 

Tl;dr 
Pros: 
* Great leadership; they really care about their people
* Lots of transparency
* Employee skill set
* Level of accountability in employees
* Demonstrated living of mission and values by everyone

Cons:
* Like all startups, frequent change
* Short 1-2 Product Managers
* Feeling there is no clear marketing roadmap

I can't say enough about how well this young company is functioning. The executive staff is continually trying to do the right thing for business, employees, and students. The CEO regularly has personal chats with every employee to hear what he and the company can do to improve. The leaders regularly seek input from managers, who in return seek input from individual contributors. It is obvious that not only do the executives care about their employees, but they listen to what people say. An example: when Treehouse executives announced they needed to conduct layoffs, employees asked if there would be any job placement assistance or if we could continue to use the Treehouse product for free. Executives followed up by reaching out to other companies in effort to find comparable jobs for those who were laid off, and employees cut are able to continue to use the product free of charge.

The amount of transparency is refreshing too, but can be too much for some employees. I was shocked to see financial records during my first company all hands meeting, and even more surprised to hear the questions posed by attendees about typically restricted/executive eyes only data being openly answered by the executives. Another example of transparency is when all employees were told a month ahead of time of the pending layoffs. 

It's refreshing to be in an organization where employees are trusted to do their jobs, and they do it well. I have had the opportunity to work with some smart individuals here and there, but Treehouse has some how found a way to hire only top talent. Even the most junior developer is incredibly skilled and talented. Without a doubt Treehouse employs top notch people.

During my interview process I learned all of my direct reports were remote and immediately became concerned with the quality of output, and level of collaboration and accountability. Within my first week I quickly realized I had nothing to worry about; everyone I worked directly with was a hard working, highly collaborative and supportive employee, who was a great example of what accountable looks like. As a manager it was refreshing to not have to push or monitor employees to get deliverables completed on time. It has been an honor to work with so many fine employees. 

Treehouse has both company and department level mission and value statements. Like many companies, these values are posted in common/public areas, mentioned in company meetings, and they are included in the measuring of employee performance. However, unlike many companies, the mission and values are part of everyday life and most conversations.","Because Treehouse is young, executives and managers are still trying to identify the best way to do things. This is great. Unfortunately though, this results in change in processes, tool usage, team membership, and the products we focus on. In general these changes aren't bad, nor unnecessary, but for some it can be too frequent, viewed as unnecessary, or just plan stressful. If change is something you find stressful, Treehouse may not be the place for you.

Part of figuring out how to effectively operate things at Treehouse, includes finding the right number of employees to smoothly deliver the desired product. Project Management is a young department, barely a year old, so they are understaffed by a person or two. This isn't overall bad, just makes things a bit challenging at times and it seems the Product Managers have too much on their plate.",22 Aug 2016 -

Treehouse,"Great People, AWFUL and Untrustworthy Management",2.0,"Great colleagues who are helpful, friendly and collaborative. The product speaks for itself.","Treehouse management changes its mind every month or two and unfortunately none of the changes in the past few years have done anything to drive profitability.

Worse than that, Treehouse continually cheats its employees out of fundamental parts of their compensation and benefits. A year ago, a 32-hr works week was a key component of the job and employees were paid well below market in trade for the shorter work week - fair enough. However, over the past year, management demanded that employees go into ""sprint mode"" for 3 months, where they were forced to work 40 hrs - for no additional compensation. In addition, other fringe benefits were cut, which meant less compensation. Just recently, Treehouse decided to change to a 40-hr work-week with ZERO change in compensation...employees could either work an extra day/week for free or ""voluntarily"" be laid off.

To make a long story short: if you decide to work for Treehouse, assume ANY benefit or promise of future compensation is either a lie or could be taken away before long. Never have I seen an agreement violated so many times in such a short time.

Aside form that, management seems to have no ability to leverage a great product - decisions, predictions and financial models are consistently half-baked or just plain wrong leading to recurring turmoil. Buyer beware.",24 Jul 2016 - Anonymous Employee

As a remote employee, it is often difficult to differentiate what is simply inadvertent ""being out of the loop"" due to being a remote employee and what is changes in transparency from the executive team. And sometimes management feels a bit like a whiplash scenario from previously being a flat organization. There definitely is some level of micromanagement that can be exhausting if you're an otherwise responsible person.

The cons are very relative though and I think the longer you work for a company that gives you so many benefits, it becomes easier to lose sight of how good what you have is.",4 Apr 2016 - Anonymous Employee
Treehouse,Awesome Place; Tech Company & Mission Driven,5.0,"+Treehouse is an awesome place to work for so many reasons!   The company is mission driven, with the goal of changing the world by creating affordable, high-quality technology education.  But it is also unique, because it is a Technology company looking to scale, so you really have the best of both worlds.

+The management team really values creating a strong and fun company culture, and places a lot of emphasis on providing work life balance (merit based work;  4 day work week;  flexible schedule / remote work in a lot of cases, etc).   Staff respect the work flexibility, and stay focused to ensure work is being completed.  

+It's great to work with such a driven and intelligent team.  Always inspiring to hear every week from customers how much they love Treehouse and how the quality of learning is far better than other options on the market.","-Treehouse is still a young company; with that comes opportunity but also strain.  

-If you like the idea of things changing rapidly, and having the opportunity to identify an idea and run with it, you should do well here.  If you want to know exactly what your role will be and the projects you'll be working on in the future, or dislike pivoting without much notice, then it may not be the best fit.  The culture, camaraderie, work flexibility, and communication from management at Treehouse make this super easy to manage, but it's still a start-up atmosphere, so really depends on your personal preference.

-Some others have mentioned growing pains, but the changes being implemented will improve the company trajectory and over time will create more opportunities for all.",2 Mar 2016 - Anonymous Employee
Treehouse,Leadership needs to change,2.0,"Incredible mission, and I still hear from people how Treehouse helped change their life. 4-day workweek means incredible work/life balance. Great healthcare plans and 401k matching.","4 day workweek, over half the company is remote, and the others are split between two offices in Portland and Orlando which creates pockets of culture that don't quite mesh into a cohesive company culture. EVERYTHING is micromanaged, the CEO changes his mind with the direction of the wind, etc. Typical Founder/CEO, who is an incredibly outwardly nice guy, but I've unfortunately seen his true colors as well, and have never been impressed by his management skills or style.  Career advancement opportunities are also meager, the pay is lackluster (they truly pay you for only 4 days a week despite claiming otherwise). The team I worked on had zero chemistry; I don't think anyone actually even liked each other, bc hiring for culture fit when you have no real culture is impossible. By the time I was unceremoniously let go, I was disillusioned with senior management, my coworkers and even the mission.

Treehouse,"Meaningful Mission, Great People",5.0,"Treehouse is a great place to work if you care about working on something meaningful.  I enjoy working for a company that is driven to make people's lives better.  It's inspiring to hear feedback from Treehouse students and see how learning to code has made a difference for them.  It really makes you motivated to do your job in a way that contributes back to the larger mission.

Treehouse has built a great team.  Although about half of the people work remotely, using video conferencing and productivity tools (like Slack and Asana), makes it actually more efficient than other places I have worked.  I was afraid when I joined that I wouldn't have a strong connection with my co-workers because of the remote working situation, but there is a great culture that extends through the different internal communication channels.  People on the team are bright, and genuinely good people.  Everyone is working on the common goal of helping students succeed.  It's definitely one of the major perks of working here.

Another aspect of Treehouse I enjoy is the startup energy of the company.  I feel like we are at the beginning of building something huge and important.  Many of my co-workers are focused on fundamental challenges like building a great product, ensuring students are successful, or creating a sustainable business.  In my experience, individuals can have a huge impact at Treehouse.

Finally, the company has a unique perspective on employees and their commitment to the company.  It used to be called a ""32 Hour Work Week"", where you were encouraged to only work Monday through Thursday.  There has been a lot of change over the past year and they remain committed to allowing employees to balance their time.  While Fridays are still considered a non-work day, I tend to use Fridays to go deeper into aspects of my job that are hard to focus on during the whirlwind of the week.  Being more flexible and understanding of how people use their personal time is one of the real differences of working at Treehouse.  It makes my job and my life much more enjoyable and manageable.","The company is shifting to a much more competitive stance.  The change has been hard for the whole company to absorb and an there is ambiguity on what the new expectations are.  

In the past there were no managers, 32 hour weeks, and you could work on anything you wanted.  It didn't really help advance the business, but individuals had a ton of freedom.  They have now installed managers, and processes to better coordinate and execute.  As expected, some of these things are great and some feel heavy-handed.  Its been a hard adjustment, but in my opinion it was overdue.  

Finally, not having everyone in the same building allows Treehouse to find and hire the best talent, but I sometimes wish I could have more connection to the remote employees.  While on the whole, it works well, there is still something to be said for having people in the same room working on problems together.",22 Feb 2016 - Anonymous Employee

I work with amazing, incredibly smart and fun folks here, and I'm proud of the work we do. I work hard, but Treehouse allows me to set the kind of boundaries that prevent dissatisfaction and burnout.","Treehouse has recently shifted some aspects of its culture, most particularly moving from a ""flat"" organization to a tiered, more traditional one, within about a year. That's been a big transition, and it can lead to some short-term confusion. It's also been hard for some longer-term. I personally prefer it, and I believe it's best in the long run: more accountability means we get more done and help more students.

We still have the 4-day work week, but managers are back.

The problem is, they are managing through fear. Managers are always trying to measure performance, and dropping hints that employees who aren't performing will be fired. It kills morale.

We have several meetings a week where we do nothing more than report our progress. We also use 2 or 3 different project management tools, where we give the same report we did in our meetings. Everyone is more worried about making the reports look good than about making Treehouse better. If you have an idea, you can suggest it to your manager, but they usually shoot it down.

Uncharted,Director,5.0,"Where to start? Awesome team, incredible mission, great work/life balance--there's so much to love about Uncharted!

To be more specific, I worked at Uncharted for three years in various roles, and I had a great experience. Here are a few of the many pros: 

--I was given a lot amount of responsibility and freedom from day one despite my limited professional experience 
--Your team will trust you 100%, and even if you make a mistake it's treated as a chance to learn rather than a red mark on a test
--You get to work with incredibly talented and driven entrepreneurs who are working on inspiring solutions to the world's biggest problems
--The mentor and investor network! This is a network of people you'll get to hang out with that includes people like former execs at Yahoo, Google, HP, and EDs from the world's best nonprofits. Pretty darn cool.
--The staff and the culture at Uncharted are unparalleled. This is a young, fun loving team who works hard and has each other's back
--Great work/life balance with ample time off and a flexible work from home policy. There are some weekends and evenings required during accelerators, but otherwise I felt like I could unplug during evenings, weekends, and vacations
--Great benefits and compensation. Compensation is tied to the 75th percentile of Colorado-based nonprofits and the benefits are very good--health, vision, dental, along with parental leave policies are among the best i've encountered

The other important thing to know about Uncharted is that the entire team has spent a tremendous amount of time and energy making the CEO, Teju,  believe that he's actually good at ping pong. And you'll be expected to do the same. This conspiracy is so extensive that every entrepreneur, mentor, and guest that has ever come to the office or a program has had to be secretly warned before arriving that they need to let Teju win, otherwise his delicate ego would be crushed. I spent 3 years losing to him despite being easily able to beat him any given day with my offhand. But it's a condition of employment at Uncharted that you keep this going, so I did it. 

Kidding. Did I mention the team is fun-loving? 

In summary, Uncharted gets an A+ for  mission, culture, compensation and work/life balance. This is a great place for self-starters and entrepreneurial people who are looking to use their talent and energy to make the world a better place and have one hell of a good time doing it.","I have no major cons, but here are a few observations I made during my time at Uncharted: 

--There was no clear performance or feedback policy, so it was hard to get constructive feedback unless you actively and consistently seek it out
--Not really a con as much as just a general observation, but as with any small nonprofits there was limited upward mobility
--Little to no active management from superiors. Again, not necessarily a con but I'd say that people who are highly self-directed would do well while those looking for more oversight, training and guidance may find it difficult
--Little to no professional development opportunities (i.e. manager training, project management courses, etc) 
--Strategy and roles shifted often, which was exciting but at times caused disconcert & confusion
--At times the organizational structure and chain of command was unclear",9 Aug 2017 - Director

Unito,"A startup vibe, with a mature company structure",5.0,"The way I see it, the three attributes that make a great business (from an employees' perspective) are the following:

1. Fun vibe
2. Hard work and performance tracking
3. Work-life balance

Too often, I've seen businesses fall into the trap of forcing employees to chose only two of the three attributes. Work hard, play hard, but you're first in last out. Or have a fun environment and great work-life balance, but everything else tanks. 

At Unito, we're so lucky to have all three of those attributes. I'm impressed every. single. day. by how smart and hardworking my colleagues are. The vibe is always light, we have so much fun together, but we all have families that we go back to in the evening (at a decent hour!!!!)

I was also pleasantly surprised to see how structured and well-thought-out processes are at Unito. It's a rare thing for a startup, but it makes it so much easier not only to get your work done but also to understand how everything you're doing fits into the bigger picture.

Compensation is transparent in the business, which I find removes considerable stress and makes it so that there is very little in the company that is taboo.","Despite my glowing review of their processes, one thing does stand out to me as being an important process that needs to be addressed and fixed: how they let people go.",14 Jul 2020 - Anonymous Employee

Unito,A company with vision and soul,5.0,"A place with a solid company culture. They have the perfect blend between human-centric respect and the drive and vision of a company that can revolutionize their market and industry.

Here are a few highlights of working at Unito:

- Transparency. All important data are all available at any time. Sales, profits, salaries, expenses, projections. No hidden agenda, management and executive try to be as transparent as they can.

- Area of responsibilities. Every employee has at least one area where he/she is responsible for. That enhances the sense of purpose , mastery and expertise.

- Recruitment and hiring process is tight. Every new hire has passed through a 'Pilot project' where they collaborate on real projects before receiving an offer. This helps build solid teams that will align quickly to deliver value.

- Teamwork is the first option. If work can be done and assigned to a team, it is normally the preferred way. Working and learning with colleagues enhance motivation and growth mindset.

- Properly funded. Great investors who knows the reality of SaaS companies.","- It's a startup. Meaning changes and adaptation is at the core of the daily life. If you are looking for normalized workflow that hasn't change in years, this might not be the perfect fit. 

- The product is great and promising , but still in its 'market fit' phase. Meaning that product new features and quick adjustments are a bit more important than stability and performance.

WANdisco,It's been emotional‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,5.0,"I recently left the company having worked in Sales for almost 2 years, having read the reviews on here I felt compelled to write my own.

I leapt at the opportunity to join WANdisco having previously worked for another Big Data startup, I knew how disruptive the space was becoming

I joined initially in Inside Sales with a view to advance into field sales. Sales of our Big Data products were slow for the first 12 months, we were very early to market and most companies were playing with Hadoop in a sandbox or still trying to figure out what Hadoop was. Fortunately WANdisco‚Äôs ALM business has seen significant growth year or year and so I was able to meet quota and make money selling those products to the Silicon Valley Top 100 whilst developing a pipeline of Big Data opportunities. 

Nobody can deny WANdisco has pretty cool technology; they solve a problem that computer scientists still say is impossible.  The company has real patents around the way in which you manage failures of entire datacenters, applied to Hadoop their driving enterprise adoption as all of the fortune 1,000 augment or replace their legacy 3 tier client server architecture to data rich architectures like Hadoop.","As with the other reviews you read on here I saw a lot of sales people come and go during my tenure with the company. Whilst I enjoyed beers with many of them they simply didn‚Äôt have the pace required of a startup and were averse to change ‚Äì hardly ingredients for a high growth tech start up, never mind one that was public.

All in all my experience has been a good one, there have been highs and lows ‚Äì it‚Äôs been emotional as they say. I enjoyed the opportunity to travel and sell overseas, helping to open our APAC office and train the sales team. I‚Äôve learned a lot and look forward to applying this in my next role.

WANdisco,The Excitement of joining WANdisco quickly erroded and became a dog eat dog battleground.,1.0,"I joined the company as a sales person because I believed that their Big Data Strategy and Value Proposition was hitting the emerging and growing Big Data market at the right time.

The other issue that I discovered with that the company had a very acidic culture (high sales turnover rate) especially within the Sales Organization. It quickly became evident that they ate their own children as a way for the Leadership Team to deflect the focus away from them and blame the sales people for their lack of success. in exploiting the opportunities within the Big Data market. Wandisco's Leadership Team lacks the substance to make this a viable growing business. Their business model is not profitable and likely will never be.,11 Dec 2014 - Anonymous Employee

WANdisco,I work with top talent every day,5.0,"I can only speak to how things are in the UK engineering/development side of the business. The prospects for the company's growth and for employees' future career prospects are looking great right now. Individual software engineers are valued as key talent by the management rather than treated as interchangeable development resources. People with drive/self-motivation can learn and progress quickly. Even if you're new to the industry you will be given responsibility straight away if you can handle it. Working with top quality engineers every day makes you learn your craft more quickly and thoroughly than you would at many other software houses. The domains we're working in (Big Data and ALM) are very interesting. The only other companies in the UK I'm aware of that could offer similar levels of job satisfaction for software developers in terms of interesting subject matter are probably some of the quantitative finance places.

The company's pivot to focusing on Big Data is really exciting for WANdisco's engineers. Many of us in the Sheffield office are practically salivating at getting started. My perspective on recent restructuring is that senior management have handled the changes extremely well and have looked after current employees. In particular I've been impressed with how Fletch (our SVP of Engineering) has handled the transition. As part of this I think a lot of smart UK employees have been recognised for what they've done and what they can do going forwards.

In the UK we get unlimited paid holiday - although I enjoy my work enough that this isn't really as big a deal as it sounds! We also have really fun social events every month. If you fancy getting in a bit later in the morning then that's fine too - you're expected to manage yourself, your breaks, start time, home time, etc. If you're the kind of person who wants to get in late and leave early then you won't be working here anyway. I know some other companies' engineering departments treat their developers like children, with disciplinary meetings for being 5 minutes late 3 times and so on, so it is nice to be treated like adults. The calibre of people working here means that this kind of thing isn't abused and so hopefully this attitude will continue as the company grows.","The most interesting work is carried out in San Ramon, which has to be expected but is a little bit demotivating for UK staff. Everyone in Engineering in the UK is talented and motivated, which means that you don't stand out as much as you would in a company where the levels of talent are more varied. It's nice to think that you're smart but everyone else is too. You'll need to be an A player to work in development. There is a culture of working really hard which might seem like a negative point to some and a positive to others.",20 Jul 2014 - Anonymous Employee
WANdisco,Fine place if you're not in Sales,3.0,"There are some really bright people in engineering that are doing cutting-edge work. The company has nice group functions and they provide nice equipment, such as laptops, to their employees. A friendly group of people, with an entrepreneurial spirit; everyone seems willing to help others. 

The company does have patented technology that can bring tremendous value to their customers.","The biggest problem this company has is sales leadership. ""Immature"" best describes the sales leadership. They are constantly changing direction; moral is very low, but on the surface everyone puts on a smile.  As you get under the veneer, you find unhappy players, unless they are in the right clique. 
Don't be fooled, the negative reviews are not from ex-sales people who were weeded out.  In fact, at least two salespeople had closed significant opportunities and believed they were getting a ""congratulations"" call when it was in fact a ""you're no longer needed call.""  I know first hand of one, and have heard of another sales person engaged in legal action with the company in an effort to collect commission on legitimately closed business. 
The sales organization routinely falls well short of sales goals, and the company is sustained on investor money. Take a look at their financial reports and decide for yourself. 

Another big concern is that Hadoop is starting to add the capabilities that WANdisco provides into native Hadoop. If you talk with Couldera or Hortonworks most of their field reps believe Hadoop can now natively do what  WANdisco does. That's partially true, but  WANdisco does bring a better high availability, replication functionality. However, WANdisco is quickly being necessary only at companies that have highly critical applications. Will native Hadoop eventually cover this use case as well?  I don't know. WD has patent protections for their implementation, but there's always more than one way to skin a cat (and achieve high avability)",18 Jul 2014 - Sales Organization

A lot of companies would have probably held back on bringing on new employees, but true to Wonderlic's phenomenal culture they welcomed me with open arms and a barrage of support.

Now almost 6 months in, I can honestly say this is the best company I've ever worked for. Yes, there's a lot going on, but it's all really great and innovative work at a company that is still growing despite being over 80 years old.

The leadership team is also emblematic of what the company is striving to achieve. In other words, they practice what they preach. They are involved in everything in the best ways possible, and really allow individual teams and contributors to bring fresh ideas to the table. The only expectation here is that you deliver on what you say you will, and ultimately help the company continue to scale. There's also a wealth of great collaboration across all teams.

There's a wealth of pride, support and opportunity here. I hope to be here for a long time, because it's rare that you find a successful business with so many positive things to look forward to every day.",None that I've found so far.,2 Sept 2020 - Anonymous Employee

Once COVID started becoming a concern, we went from being in the office to being 100% remote very quickly and the company made this transition feel seamless. Wonderlic is also allowing us to continue working fully remote until COVID is essentially no longer a concern. This decision by leadership truly shows how much they care about their employees and value safety above all else. It also reveals how supportive they are of working parents that are currently trying to manage their daily jobs while also trying to watch their kids due to the daycares being closed.

Wonderlic,Wonderlic: Where work & life actually balance,5.0,"Some backstory of my employment life in the years leading up to my joining Wonderlic:

To say I've had a couple of rough stops as my career has blossomed would be an understatement. I spent a good deal of time at a company where I was promoted from Marketing Director to Vice President, and for a while I thought I'd be there forever. However, they treated their employees pretty poorly and wanted them working 24/7 which resulted in them rank-ordering their 200 employees by the amount of time they worked calculated by typing on a keyboard+moving a mouse+time on work phone. With a young daughter at home, it didn't make sense to me to constantly have the distractions and interruptions while at home, so I made a switch to a new company closer to home that desperately needed a marketing leader. 

Sadly, that switch wound up being (italics for emphasis) absolutely (end italics for emphasis) terrible as work/life balance went out the door COMPLETELY over five painful months.

I honestly couldn't believe that in 2019 companies were operating this way, but outlook was bleak and my personal reality at the time was employers didn't care about me regardless of the results I (and my teams) delivered. Sigh.

BUT THEN I FOUND WONDERLIC (or should I say, Wonderlic found me),  and I can safely say I'm finally ""home"". I've only been here a few months, but my experience working for Wonderlic has been even better than my greatest expectations.

I was recruited by someone I trust, and during my on-site interview I met with various members of the Wonderlic leadership team. One thing I noticed was how happy they all were. They had little ones at home, and everyone up to the COO kept talking about work/life balance, flexible schedules, family, wanting to bring in talent and help people develop in their careers. As a mid-thirties professional who'd peaked elsewhere, this was music to my ears. I accepted the position offered as soon as possible and began pinching myself.

Everything I was told during the interview process was true. The company is investing a great deal of time and money into creating an atmosphere that makes their employees feel like they matter both as professionals but also as human beings. Wonderlic is heavily invested in leadership and development training as well as taking the time to recognize achievements across the board. Quarterly goals and OKRs are established as part of the professional culture which makes my job as a leader so rewarding (ok and a little bit easier). Helping steering the department and each person on the team toward hitting their goals is made so much more purposeful when senior leadership is all aligned on what those goals are - a breath of fresh air in my career. 

Regarding work/life balance, no one in the company gets in the way of your personal life nor do they want to. Never once have I been questioned if my daughter was sick, I wanted to take a day off, I had a doctor's appointment, or there was a need to work from home. The standard PTO schedule is borderline ridiculous (in a good way) with 21 paid personal days, plus 10 company paid holidays, plus a mandatory company shutdown in the week between Christmas and New Year's. 

Ok, benefits and culture are great, how's the job? Well, let me tell you so far so good! The company is invested in our department and fully enabling us to make the changes and improvements we see fit. Wonderlic is clearly dedicated to hiring subject matter expertise and letting those they hire help the company improve every single day. Working with other departments at Wonderlic is highly rewarding, because I'm constantly learning from my co-workers on a daily basis. There's true expertise across all functions - you'd have to try hard not to be inspired by your co-workers at Wonderlic on a daily basis.

tl;dr: Working at Wonderlic is amazing because of the way employees are empowered, goals are clearly defined, the impact you can have, the focus on professional development, and an unrivaled work/life balance.","In my period at Wonderlic, I honestly can't think of a con from an employer/employee standpoint.

In short, Wonderlic is an amazing workplace for those who are looking to stay at one organization for a long time.

- Small size (not great for anyone looking for the large corp. experience)
- Lack of mentors (everyone, especially leaders, are limited in time/resources to mentor those who want to grow because of the small company size)

Wonderlic,It's a question of fit,5.0,"I'm writing this to help potential future employees because the mix of positive and negative reviews must be confusing. I work in a department that serves several internal customers so I have the opportunity to see and talk to many people here. One thing I have noticed is that the people who volunteer their knowledge, offer to help, or raise their hand for special projects are the ones who get the opportunities. Those who sit at their desks waiting for good things to happen get frustrated and bitter, especially as the years add up. Recently someone was hired for a project level position and quickly was promoted to a VP position after sharing her knowledge/vision (we have 2 VP positions here, both filled by women so I'm not sure where the ""boys club"" comments come from). This sends a good message to those who get involved, but can can have a negative effect on those waiting for opportunity to land on their desk. 
One thing I love about Wonderlic is that senior leadership is very accessible and treats everyone with respect. It doesn't matter what your role is here, you can knock on leadership's door and they will invite you in to chat. I feel like they truly care about our careers and happiness here. You also will not find another employer that offers better work/life balance.
The company is changing direction and becoming a more competitive SaaS company, which is going over well with people who embrace change/the future, but not so much with people who were comfortable with the traditional ways of doing business.

Shopify,Good company overall but met with bad people within the team.,2.0,"Great benefits, great overall values and culture.","But bad is that working in the APAC team, the culture differ a lot. Everything is subjected to the lead you met. If you are with bias negative lead that then you are bound to suffer. Little support in dealing with grievous and a lot double standards and inconsistency. Should promote people from within or hire new leads that embraces the culture. Instead each time a new hub is formed the culture is shaped by the current people which may differ from the actual values of Shopify.

- Genuinely good people and managers. Fellow team members are approachable and always happy to answer your questions.

Shopify,"Democratic, meritocratic, but too big and ""too cool""",3.0,"It's a highly democratic system where everybody (at least in a Trifecta system - UX, product, engineering) has an equal say and is expected to have a say. It's also based on meritocracy where everyone advances based on their contribution and is absolutely attributed to it. 

Work-life balance and compensations are top-notch, though.","It's had a hiring surge for the last few years and it can feel like a small fish in the pond. Processes and bureaucracy can get in the way - although not as bad as corporations. The culture of building a strong case (and writing down docs) even for the smallest decision is good but sometimes becomes a nuisance. It's also become a ""cool kids"" club where everybody feels they are super good and super entitled ""to be here at Shopify"". I had my manager say ""There's a lot of candidates who applied for your position."" and a coworker say ""I went through 10-11 interviews to get here.""",26 Aug 2020 - Senior Product Designer
Shopify,Grow your tech skills but don't stay long,3.0,"- There are so many technical problems to solve that you will always be able to tackle something interesting
- Shopify is mostly full of really great supportive people. You will very easily find people that will be your friends for life and while it is hard to find a good job, it is harder to find a good team. I think in Shopify, this is more common.
- Shopify does have lots of room to learn and grow as a developer (unless you‚Äôre a FED)","To work at Shopify, you have to be okay with the fact that part of your paycheck will come from gun paraphernalia and far-right propaganda merchandise shops who use that money to fuel their ambitions, all while at the same time having leadership give 1-hour conference talks about how commerce and Shopify are morally good and that Shopify is good for society. Which I am sure for a lot of people is fine, and may start off fine as well, but it can also get very tiring over time as you see one thing and then leadership tells you another. Here are some of my main feelings about this company.

- It is always very obvious when leadership decides to not address something that they don‚Äôt like, which they often do, and often about very important things like compensation or attrition. Usually, they will not be able to answer questions and dodge them, and then suddenly every single person in leadership suddenly has the exact same answer about how this new change that you think is negative, is actually positive. Compensation is actually the best in the industry (when it proveably is not)
- Backward promotion. I suppose these are common but still a criticism. To get promotions or raise, you will have had to do the job for a year or more already. This is a good way to underpay high-performing people. 
- Work-life balance is not real. especially if you are a manager. Directors and senior staff will message at any time of day. They will say that balance is important and they spent all of ‚ÄúMental Health Month‚Äù talking about this but then go on to push harder deadlines for Unite, an annual conference hosted by Shopify. They say the R&R days (4 day work week) should not make your work more but the deadlines stay the same.
- Constantly shifting organization structure and constant release of new useless terminology. Often getting the sense that leadership uses this as an excuse to explain what work that they are doing. Sometimes their announcements of reorgs or new words to describe the work we already do, have a feeling of being made up on the spot and always end on a note of work in progress. This adds to the feeling of instability because they want us to use what they have come up with on a day-to-day basis but it could change at any moment. It also always make you feel as much f you are a pawn or resource to be moved around without regard to building community and relationships. (Which causes managers to use this as a reason to not promote or give raises)
- Pretending to be open when in fact at AMAs, the hardest questions are skipped over to the extent that they have made a team build tools to filter out questions that are too hard and report employees to HR if they asked questions that leadership doesn‚Äôt like or seems too critical. The same team built tools into slack, to direct report any employee to HR which almost immediately killed all slack discussions that were in any way critical of the company, even good-faith criticism. 
- Leadership lacks accountability and refuses to listen to feedback. Usually, when asked for accountability, they will say something along the lines that the conversation has become unproductive and wasting company time. This will often just result in slack channels being changed to read-only, forcing the conversation into other channels.
- When I joined the company, they marked themselves as a hacker culture. Everything was hackable, including the company itself. So often we had discussions about what the company could do better and how it could be better. Currently, Shopify has a culture of constantly telling its employees that if you don‚Äôt like what the company does, then you should leave. This position was used for remote working as well. They are hostile and gaslighting to employees who have dissenting opinions or criticism. 
- Most of the good culture that Shopify still retains is from the people they have hired in the past and good lower-level managers having great connections with their small teams. The company as a whole is seemingly doing nothing to support everyone other than half-assed mental health statements and talking about a future where they will fly the whole company to central points once a year. This is odd because in the same breath they will mention how environmentally conscious they are.
- Criticisms of the company are cast as direct attacks on C-levels, who are surrounded by cult-like people who think they can do no wrong. Echo chamber at the top to the extent that it seems obvious that there is a house clearing of any dissenting directors or C-levels.
- C-level execs are highly involved but are not highly informed. They will often say incorrect things, very confidently.
- Leadership has a poor opinion of UX and front-end, as displayed in the past by CEO comments on Twitter and the fact that the UX role was eliminated from Shopify. It has taken years of advocacy to get front-end developers paid nearly the same amount as backends. Leadership will often go on tirades about how no one should write javascript at all, even though javascript powers a lot of what the company does now.
- Work is not appreciated across teams, highly competitive and if the team did not create it, they will just create their own and try to destroy the other.
- Very strong not-built-here mentality where Shopify tends to rebuild things that already have solutions.
- I would feel bad for Tobi if he was not often rudely opinionated and surrounded by people who will protect him at any time. I get that he has a hard position where he is expected to run a company but still looks like (or still wants to be) highly connected to the technical aspects of dev however it is clear that he cannot. And that is completely fine. However, when he reads an article or tries something out in his spare time, he tries to push people to use things in order to feel relevant but it is clear that he has not used the technology in a sustained way. If he only brought items up as a suggestion of something he is interested in rather than something he is telling technical team that they should already be using, these would be taken a lot better, however, because of the way he approaches items like this, he wastes massive amounts of time as teams are constantly consumed with building up a case to tell him in a fully data-driven way an answer they could have just told him at the start. I mean, there has been enough coverage of Tobi tornadoes, I don‚Äôt need to re-hash.
- Managers have very little feedback loop. There is no way in Shopify to evaluate a bad manager who is causing their employees to have a bad experience. It is common for ICs to talk about who is a good lead and who is not because the only hope is to avoid the bad ones. Managers are mostly evaluated by the work their team produces and their ability to explain those things in meetings. So when managers are deliberately not promoting or doing terrible things like punitive PIPs, there is no hope for those ICs except to change teams.
- Hiring has no feedback loop. There are many people who participate in interviews that are very pretentious and biased but there is no way to tell how well interviewers are performing. We hire with committees so everyone needs to come to an agreement to combat bias but if the whole committee is full of bad interviewers then it is doing nothing for bias. I was trained years ago, which was reading a few documents and shadowing two interviews, and then nothing ever since.
- Shopify hires with a pretty strong requirement of using TDD however in practice, I would say a small minority of the people at Shopify actually practice true TDD, which just seems hypocritical.
- New hires often get paid more that tenured staff, with very reserved raises. Which is fine if you were just hired, that will only sting a few years in.
- Promotions are really a popularity contest. The loudest, most visible people get promoted the most, the quiet but highly productive people rarely get recognition.",22 Sept 2021 - Software Developer Manager

Shopify,My Honest 1 Year Review,3.0,"Overall the culture is great here and I really like MOST of the people I work with. Of course there are a few bad apples here and there that you have to deal with. The onboarding process was great and it was a fun and exciting way to join a new company. Shopify offers what I would consider a locally competitive compensation package with very competitive benefits, with the only unfortunately aspect being the decline of equity due to the fall of the stock price. With flex vacation I was able to take 5 weeks off in the last year. The company offers a lot of cool perks including the ability to work from another country for 90 days, and a discount on language lessons, just to name a few.","While the perks are great, when it gets to the day to day, it gets real bad here. I have never worked so much in my entire career. I am talking evenings and weekends on a regular basis pulling 60 hours per week on average. The issue stems from Executive Leadership and Upper Management, who simply do not know now how to plan projects, and manage their resources effectively. I find that I am constantly working on the same things over and over again because of reiterations, decision changes, and just poor planning. Much of the work my team does gets scrapped and we are told to start something else constantly and it is very frustrating. You really need a thick skin and have the ability to pivot very quickly here. 

I do feel that Executive Leadership here is still learning how to lead a large tech company after the rapid growth they experienced during 2020 and 2021, and they are really dropping the ball quite a bit. Overpromising or overcommitting to complex ideas and projects occur on a regular basis here and they have too much ego to admit that they are not the experts in what they are trying to accomplish.

While the Pros are good, I think I need to start reconsidering my options to save my own personal life and work life balance.",29 Jun 2022 - Anonymous

Most people in the office are really nice to deal with, and teams support each other - marketing in particular is really friendly. Change does happen - very slowly but it happens - and there are good people doing a lot of work to push in the right direction.

The work/life balance is generally good. Flexible working is the norm, Canon's policies on support, inclusion etc are all quite good. There were many good managers in my function (including mine) who really care about their teams and often work to support you.","The camera and printing worlds have changed massively in the last decade, but the people responsible for reporting that back to Japan have not. Worse still, many resent the modern world of content creators and vloggers, mixed shooting with phones etc and actively work against modernising how Canon sell their products. In tandem with Japan's risk aversion in marketing, this can lead to very frustrating experiences. The business is also very siloed. Collaboration happens, but it is very tribal, and there is a blame culture, despite there being no real consequences to getting anything wrong. 

Coupled with this there is very limited progression. For the right-face, right-time crowd it's good - but for others there is limited progression and next to no recognition for the work, and for the tolerance of staying at the role you are in for years on end. Budgets are small, and (although the pandemic is partially to blame for this) camaraderie and team building are things of the past. 

The company is also awful for the environment, but Corporate has begun greenwashing internally, unconvincingly. Massive murals of whales don't make up for the fact cameras and printing aren't good for the environment. Its ""sustainability"" department is a joke - a PR exercise with the loosest targets imaginable. In general, the corporate tier of the company seems very tribal, and out of touch with the people keeping it employed.",21 Mar 2022 - Marketing

It's led by ""Sales"" people who want every yesterday... which is fine. However the business is also run universally on Excel spreadsheets in SharePoint. This means lots of humans running around collecting data all the time. It's a mess... and there's no real desire to fix it....and no money either. Long story short... this is a ""stepping stone"" company for new joiners. Come in...get the job role and some experience... achieve nothing (because you can't)...leave. So sad as it could be a great business if it just woke up. However I think they're just happy with the status quo in the print industry where everyone still bobs along and by chance hits target...until they retire... leaving the mess for the next person so hopefully sort out (but they don't because they do the same thing!). 
Lastly ""office culture"". The Japanese LOVE the office and therefore... so should you. Be aware of that. Flexible working is now a thing... but they clearly don't like it. Be ready to be checked on a spreadsheet every day you are in. Despite logging the same in two other systems as well. They should focus on selling more printers... not strong arming people into a soulless office",17 Mar 2022 - Platform Manager

I have also had support from my line Director on an individual basis, personally assisting me with my workload when on holiday (and away from the office due to bereavement) to ensure the placements I had lined up would be looked after and secured, which shows the dedication and commitment they have to you and to the business.

Tulip,Short Story: Leveraging high turnover for personal gain,2.0,Opportunity for rapid promotion. Pretty generous severance packages.,"Brick and mortar is a difficult market to enter but they might be able to crack it if not for the revolving door of leaders at every level. The CEO shows signs of serious paranoia and constantly evaluates employee's ""loyalty"" to him. If you disagree, you're disloyal and you'll get fired. Even in the most senior levels where healthy discourse is critical to the success of the company, if you offer any kind of dissenting opinion, you're out. I'm talking finding-out-your-boss-was-fired-when-he-doesn't-show-up-for-your-one-on-one fired too, not ""Bob has decided to transition out over the summer"" fired. 

The CEO also has an obvious soft spot for the 10-15 people who have been with the company from the beginning, who came from his last company. They are deemed loyal. If you are not one of them then your best chances of success is to keep your head down, do the bare minimum, and wait for your boss to be fired. Take your boss's title, and coast until it's your turn. If you play your cards right, you'll leave with a better title than you started with and enough cash to last until you land your next gig. 

The day to day is frustrating, but not abusive - if you don't get too invested it's not a bad short term gig. Plus the people you meet will all end up at other companies within the year, so you'll develop a broad network.",15 Apr 2020 - Anonymous Employee

Tulip,"Awesome people, about to enter next stage of maturity, good time to built that future",4.0,"I have never enjoyed the people of a company so much. It's not like we are a homogeneous cultural clique or anything, but it's a bunch of people spanning different ages and communities who get together in a generally porous community when together and find reasons and ways to bond.

From a tech point of view, I think our outlook to software incredibly mature. We're not obsessed with hot new tech, developer egos are not a thing, we very much understand that our job is to deliver business value. Bugs and outages are not things to start blaming people for, but a thing we need to solve and eventually find out learnings from.
We are constantly balancing our understandings for long-term growth against not impacting current business value negatively, and while we've struggled with it as scaling startups do, I think we're in a really good place to be from  a technical position in late 2019 and 2020.

I really enjoy the salary strategy for developers here; I enjoy that it is purely based on tracking inflation and a matrix of responsibilities and doesn't require me using some force of personality to oversell myself in comparison to my peers. Since I don't like fighting for my livelihood and don't consider myself god's gift to engineering, I greatly appreciate this.

AThe dev team is a bit more conservative than I'd like; the enterprise nature of our solution and probably early employee dynamics means we're more distrustful of newer technology than I'd like.

Our culture is very community driven ... if you have an idea and are willing to do the work to organize and make it happen, people will participate, and as long as it isn't negatively impactful it will be supported if even informally.

Free lunch on Wednesdays

We're so close to hitting a stride and maturity of our solution that will be so exciting to be a part of.

We're very well positioned in our field and setting standards more than following them.","Open offices suck, even if you like the people making noise around you.

If you are on a customer-facing team you are still beholden to retail customers who are outdated technically and hold the balance of power; while most of the company I feel is in a good place re: work-life balance, timelines, etc ... I do think this falls short for customer-facing teams.

We're not large enough to promote people regularly, we're not large enough that strategic changes/difficulties or personnel changes aren't felt deeply.

One definitely feels a bit of a divide in value between technical teams and non-technical teams from a management level, which really sucks to hear about since socially people on different teams.

We're too small for title changes (upward or laterally) to happen all that often, so it sucks if you outgrow a junior role or want to switch into another team because you have to fight harder than at larger orgs with a bureaucracy more able to move people around. We lean too much on people actively showing off their initiative and people being attentive enough to recognize it.",5 Oct 2019 - Software Developer

Social environment if you want to make friends and the lounge has lake view and is big with all the snacks and game areas if you like hanging out 
Hires in 2019 are pretty engaged but do see cons too since some of the people hired earlier are upset about changes since new management came in
Exec has more experience than you see in start ups with big example being  founder is not a first time founder and built as CEO the ecomm site Well.ca 
CEO is like one of the staff in how he treats you in the lounge. 
HR team puts on a lot of events and there's a weekly lunch for everyone with different food each time
D&I committee and other committees like social comm are staff run and you can volunteer to any comm which makes it easier to know people outside of your group. The events are cool","Dry office so there's no beer fridge -  I miss this about my prior office but we didn't have as much food events there (here there is Mexican, Arabic, Jamaican, Indian, and more and every week is different). If you like beer more than food, this is not good and kind of unlike other startups

retail clients are just plain demanding and are counting on Tulip to solve a lot of pains - some more than what software actually can do in current state- so teams who face clients have to have a way of rolling with how how high maintenance they can be and still show solutions that meet expectations
Processes and documentation is still clunky and will probably change every few months so if you don't like change, this will feel not fun.
It's getting better but there's still some separation between technical teams in launch which are engineers who deliver software and product who are engineers who work on key features.

They have lots of office events (ping pong tournaments, donut decorating etc) to help everyone get to know one another outside of his/her desk. The office is in a great location (5 min walk from Union station) and with the flexibility to work at home too I have been able to keep my work/life balance.",Tulip is a growing company with growing pains so sometimes processes change quickly or things are not done as effectively or efficiently as they should be. It is growing fast but they still consider themselves a startup. They are beginning to develop the mindset of a larger company so that has a few bumps along the way,5 Jun 2019 - Anonymous Employee
Tulip,Lacks Technical Leadership,3.0,"The people building the product, primarily developers and designers, are a great bunch. Supportive, fun to hang out with, generally interesting. The kinds of co-workers one wants to interact with.

Work/Life balance is valued and, depending on what team you end up on (see cons) it's fairly low-stress.

Career advancement is definitely possible but, again, this depends what team you end up on.","There are big organizational and management problems in the software department. Teams don't coordinate so nobody knows what anyone else is doing. Decisions get made and nobody knows why or by whom.

Because the teams are divided up with unclear and sometimes actually conflicting delineation of responsibility, there's friction. It's not clear who calls the shots so often times conflicting calls get made, only to surface after work has been completed and people are left asking ""how did this happen?"" It really feels like there are 4 separate software departments each with their own cultures and ideas about how to work. Then, once in a while, the CEO will appear and mandate something as specific as how the code is structured.

Whether or not you have an opportunity to advance as a dev and do what you want to do, and how much stress you're under, really depends on what team you end up on. Even whether or not you can switch teams completely depends on where you are.",18 May 2019 - Software Developer
Tulip,Wasted Potential,1.0,"The social events, Wednesday lunches, and all other initiatives by HR are trying to mitigate the bad working environment, but at least they are trying. 

Majority of software devs in the company are nice and supportive, but unfortunately they are heading aimlessly into opposite directions. 

Good place for co-ops or fresh grads, but if you are a person with senior experience, this is not a place for you.","This place acts and  function more like a heavy corporate than a startup, with one caveat they took the corporate bad side; politics, favoritism, group conforming and left out the good side of corporate: process, cadence and tech leadership.

Tulip tech leadership is not existent, the company is divided to three or four different software development entities with competing priorities and conflicting incentives and harrowing lack of accountability. The tech stack is a mess, from an inherited DB to multiple middle layer APIs, to a mess of customized and ""split"" apps on the iOS front end. Languages used are php, go, jscript and Obj-C/Swift however, no clear direction or intent to have a proper high level architecture or design decisions or any technical guidance. They treat every new features as a POC and let their customers do QA for them. Code quality is horrible, with most of the code written by coops or outsourced contractors, no unit-testing, no documentation, no architecture design, nothing, just up to the dev to do whatever they want. 

Culture is toxic and heavily skewed towards ""Favorites and being on the good side of your manager or the higher-ups"". they do not allow or entertain any different or opposing opinion, not a healthy environment for a constructive discussion around the problems they are facing, which are a lot of critical problems for a startup of this size. Also, do not even dare to ask about the company strategy. Anyone who deviates from the ""drawn"" role for them is labeled as a negative person, not a team player and will be booted out of the door at the earliest opportunity.  

Not surprisingly customers are furious with the company, and the management approach to this is to prepare ""escape goats"" for each customer failure and fire them to show their customers that they are ""acting"". 

Very very poor strategic direction for the company, no clear strategy on which customers to attract, what markets to compete in, product offering or anything, this is on the CEO shoulder, who seems out of his place when faced with these challenges. He is a good ""techie"" but not a good CEO.",19 Jun 2019 - Software Development

Tulip,Amazing company with lots of potential,5.0,"- Tulip is a very mature startup which offers cool perks like other startups such as free lunches, lots of snacks, pingpong table, paid time off during holidays. At the same time, it offers a more professional environment than most startups since most of the clients are big names in retail and the work required to service them is really skill building and transferable to many environment

- CEO is very approachable and you can easily have a good chat with him during lunch time or when he is around the office.

- You can find tons of internal opportunities for advancement because the company is growing very fast, and the company encourages people to move into the right spot with their skill set when new opportunities open up (it happens a lot).

- Tulip also invests heavily in its people, there are professional training opportunities for every team and PD allowance for staff. 

- Executive team is working very hard to improve internal communications and to ensure employees' voices are being heard.

- Beautiful lake view from the office. Office is also right at Union station and connected to the Downtown PATH so you can do a lot without having to walk out in Winter.","Collaboration among teams seems to have been lacking in the past, though executive management is putting a lot of efforts to address this issue. Feels like optimal outcomes for collaboration may take a few months.",31 Dec 2018 - Anonymous Employee

Tulip,Intense interview process but they seem to be intentional about hiring and prioritizing fit,5.0,"- Really great CEO who is both a visionary with tech and people minded (this is rare)
- Employees who interviewed me all seem engaged and understand both the challenges ahead and the opportunities
- Seems like there is a good amount of focus on getting communication and culture right
- Almost everyone who interviewed me seemed really professional (this is not exactly my experience with other start up interviews) and an expert in their area",- Seems like there are a couple of identified challenges for growth to the next level. Challenges didn't seem insurmountable and there was surprisingly open dialogue about it (that was actually impressive- that level of awareness at all levels that I spoke to) but some of the staff seem to not have gone through change and scaling stages before. Those staff in particular seemed either spooked or maybe not up for the challenge of dealing with the growth issues that come when startups are tested before the next level. This may be a short term challenge for culture building  but not necessarily a long term issue if they don't make it into an identify crisis and just deal with it as part of the growth patterns that come with the territory.,19 Sept 2018 - Anonymous Employee
